常用的英语时态

![](/Users/gmx/Documents/workspace/English/docs/assets/常用英语时态.png)

时态的四大难点：

* 1 时&态未分清
* 2 动词变位：单词拼写改变
* 3 助动词有时出现有时不出现，也要进行动词变位
* 4 时态与其他语法概念混在一起:  情态动词，否定，被动

一般现在时

* 构成

  * 动词原形

  * 动词原形+s(第三人称单数)

* 表达事实陈述 
* 表达习惯/重复的动作 I play basketball
* 表示预计发生的事 The bus leaves at 8PM everyday

现在进行时: 正在做某事

* 构成：助动词be的变位(is,am,are)+动词的现在分词(v+ing)

  * be

    * 连系动词

    * 助动词，构成时态

* I am eating a carrot.

现在完成时态：表达对于现在的时间已经完成的动作**对现在造成影响**

* 助动词have的变位(have,has)+动词的过去分词(v+ed)
  * have
    * 实义动词
    * 助动词，构成时态
*  英语“不规则”动词“规律”: https://www.yingyutu.com/bgz
* I have eaten a carrot

现在完成进行时态：对于现在不但已经完成一部分还要继续进行

* have的变位+been+动词的现在分词
* I have beem eating a carrot

一般过去时

* +动词过去式(v+ed) 
* 过去式!=过去分词
*  英语“不规则”动词“规律”: https://www.yingyutu.com/bgz

* 用法
  * 过去的习惯动词 I used to play basketball

过去进行时态：强调去过某个时间段某个动作是正在进行中的

* 助动词be的变位(was, were)+动词的现在分词(v+ing)

过去完成时态：表达过去某一点 A的过去B对A的影响

* 助动词have的变位had+动词的过去分词
* I had eaten 5 carrots for lunch yesterday, so I wasn't hungry at all yesterday afternoon.

过去完成进行时态：对过去某个点不但已经完成一部分还要继续进行

* 助动词have的变位had+been+动词的现在分词
* The rabbit had been eating a carrot

一般将来时态

* will+动词原形
* 描述
  * 将来某个时间点发生的动作(说话者十分确定会发生的事)
  * 如果不太确定某事会发生，就不能用一般将来时 ，要借助动词的“语气”

将来时态需要助动词帮忙

英语表达将来时态

* 一般现在时可以表达将来的动作：The bus leaves at 8PM
* 助动词be的变位+going+to+动词原形：I am going to eat a carrot
* 甚至上句的going可以省略，变为助动词be的变位+to+动词原形，如You are to eat a carrot
* 又或者也可以用介词about取代going；即：+about to+动词原形，如：I am about to eat a carrot.

将来进行时态

* will +be + 动词的现在分词
* 描述：将来某个时间，某个动作时在进行的过程中
* 确定某个事情在将来一定会发生可以用将来进行时

将来完成时

* will+have+动词的过去分词
* 将来某一点A的过去B对A的影响
* I will have finsihed making the video by 4PM tomorrow, so I can publish it after that.
* 想表达特别特别确定某事可以用将来完成

将来完成进行时态

* will+have+动词的现在分词
* 对将来某个点不但已经完成一部分还要继续进行
* You will have been watching my video

一般过去将来

* would+动词原形
* Was/were going to +动词原形
* I said I would wat a carrot for lunch、
* would
  * 用在一般过去将来时态
  * 用在虚拟语气 If I were you, I would eat a carrot
  * 表示礼貌 would you pass me the carrot, pls ,比Will you更礼貌；would you like a carror for lunch 比do you 更礼貌

过去将来进行时

* would+be+动词现在分词
* I said I would be wating a carrot at 1PM tomorrow/yesterday

过去将来完成时

* would+have+动词过去分词
* I said I would have eaten a carror by 1PM tomorrow/yeaterday

过去将来完成进行时

* would+have been+ 动词现在分词
* I said I would have been eating lunch for 2 hours by 1PM

## 动词语气 verb moods

![](/Users/gmx/Documents/workspace/English/docs/assets/动词语气.png)

虚拟语气可以存在在不同类型对从句中

动词语气

* 陈述语气 indicative mood
* 祈使语气 Imperative mood (命令/请求)
* 虚拟语气 subjunctive mood
* 疑问语气
* 条件语气：If I saw the rabbit tommorrow, I will bite him.
* 感叹语气

祈使语气

* Be quiet

英语思维：如何描述动作/时间

* 虚拟语气：描述脑中想象与现实相悖的想象，主观意愿

* 陈述语气祈使语气：现实描述，直接请求/命令

虚拟语气: 用法：

* 表 不可能假设

  * 表示和现在事实相反：
    * 条件句：过去式；主句：would+动词原形
    * If I saw the rabbit now, I would bite him.

  * 表示和将来事实相反(可能性很小)：
    * 条件句：should+动词原形；主句：would+动词原形； 主句的would可以用should，could，might替换，也要看具体语境；条件句中的sould可以用were to取代
    * If I should see the rabbit tomorrow, I would bite him
    * shall  --> should; 

  * 表示和过去已经发生的事实相反，不可能发生的情况：
    * 条件句：had+动词过去分词；主句：would have+动词过去分词；
    * If I had seen the rabbit a few days ago, I would bite him.

* 表达愿望，请求，建议，命令等

  * 对现在的愿望(不可能)
    * I wish that I were a rabbit
    * I would rather that you didn't;t e at the carrot
    * If I were you, I would eat a carrot.
  * 对过去的愿望
    * wish+ had / would have +动词过分分词
    * I wish that I had eaten the carrot.
    * I would rather that you hadn't eat the carrot
  * 对将来的愿望
    * wish + should/could/might + 动词原形
    * I wish I could eat the carrot
  * 这样的动词包括

    * would rather
    * demand， suggest，insist, order  后面一律加should+动词原形
      * I demand that you should give me a carrot
      * I demanded that you should give me a carrot
      * I suggest that you should eat a carrot （宾语从句）

    * It is time that you ate a carror（定语从句）

shall  --> should; 

will --> would

Can --> could

may --> might

## 非谓语动词non-finitive verbs

谓语动词(限定性动词) vs 非谓语动词(非限定动词)

谓语动词是句子核心，非谓语动词只能出现在非核心部分中。

一个简单句只能有一个谓语动词，其他的动词是非谓语动词。

非谓语动词失去表达时间和人称的本领

I like **to eat** carrots.

I liked **eating** carrots

I am a **talking** rabbit

The rabbit likes **minced** carrots.



过去分词：被动/完成

现在分词：主动/进行

不定式：将要

.....

### 动词不定式 infinitive

* 构成：to + 动词原形
* 分类

  * 完全不定式

  * 裸不定式
* 做主语

  * To eat a carrot every day is good for the rabbit.
  * It is good for the rabbit to eat  a carrot every day 形式主语
  * It is good that the rabbit eats a carrot every day
  * To eat every kind of carrot in the world is the rabbot's dream = The rabbot's dream is to eat every kind of carrot in the world
* 做宾语

  * The rabbot likes to eat carrots.
  * I consider it important to eat a carrot every day 形式宾语
* 做宾语补语

  * The rabbit expected the wolf to eat a carrot
  * see find watch have make let 这些使役动词后面用不定式做宾补省略to，即裸不定式
    * Carrots make the rabbit fell happy
  *  还有谓语动词后接不定式作宾补时，省不省to区别不大，都是正确的：help
    * The wolf helped the rabbit grow carrots
    * The wolf helped the rabbit to grow carrots
  * The rabbot's 
* 作定语

  * The rabbit has a lot of carrots to eat
* 作状语: 有简化从句的功效

  * 表原因

    * I was surprised to get a thumbs-up = I was surprised because I got a thumbs-up
  * 表目的
    
    * I will do anything to get a thumbs-up = I will do anything in order that I  get a thumbs-up
  * 表结果
    
    * I got enough thumbs-up to make another video=I got enough thumbs-up, so that I  make another video
    

* 高级不定式
  * to + 动词原形（状态）
  * to be eating a carrot: The rabbit seemed to be eating a carrot
  * to have eaten a carrot: 用法少见 The rabbit will appear to have eaten a carrot
  * to have been eating a carrot

### 动名词

动词原形+ing

动名词相当于名词

作主语

* Eating carrots is healthy for the rabbot

作主语补语

* The rabbit's hobby is growng carrots.

作定语, 容易和现在分词作定语混淆

* a sleeping pill= a pill for sleeping 

做宾语

*  The rabbits likes eating carrots. The rabbot stopped  eating a carrot  停止正在做的事 The rabbot forgot accepting the wolf's invitation
* The rabbots likes to eat carrots. The rabbot stopped to eat a carrot  停下手中发事来做某事 The wolf forgot to invite the rabbit to her party.
* 有的动词后面不可以用不定式 enjoy，advise，consider，escape，mind，practice, insist on, give up, feel like, put off 等

* 介词+宾语
  * The rabbit is found of eating carrots
  * The rabbit is looking forward to seeing the wolf again

### 现在分词

现在进行时=be+现在分词

现在分词并不是自带时间,不带现在的属性

非谓语动词没有时间变化

a talking rabbit

现在分词 vs 动名词

现在分词作定语 a sleeping rabbit != a rabbit for sleeping   相当于形容词，形容兔子的状态

动名词作定语： a sloping pill = a pill for sleeping ; 相当于名词



作表语

* The rabbit is charming

* The story is interesting

* the game is exciting

* The new is encouraging

作宾补

* The wolf saw the rabbit eating a carrot.  现在分词作宾补表示动作正在进行中，强调动作进行的状态
* The wolf saw the rabbit eat a carrot. 不定式作宾补表示动作自始至终，强调动作已经发生

作状语：简化了从句

* 表时间，原因，条件，结果，让步，目的，方式，伴随等
* Hearing the new, the rabbit became excited
* Not knowing what to eat, the rabbit skipped lunch 原因状语从句

### 过去分词

过去分词不能自带时间，不表示过去

作定语

* The rabbit will eat minced carrot next week

* 过去分词短短语作定语要放到被修饰的名词之后：后置定语
  * The carrot cake eaten by the rabbot is delicious 

 作表语

* The rabbit is interested in growing carrots 暗含被动关系，被描述的是动作的接受者

* The story is interesting.  现在分词暗含主动关系，被描述的事做出动作的人或物
* The rabbit was frightened 兔子感到害怕
* The rabbit was frightening 兔子令人感到害怕

作宾补

* The rabbit found his carrot stolen

作状语

* Seen from the hil, the carrot field looks beautiful 地点， 主语carrot是seen的逻辑主语他们是被动关系
* Seeing the carrot filed, the rabbit ran towards it.

* Born in a rabbit family,, the rabbit has been growing carrots all his life 原因

* Given another chance, the rabbit would go to the wolf's party 条件
* 用现在分词还是过去分词，要看句中到底是主动含义还是被动含义

高级用法:让句中只含一个谓语动词，其他变成非谓语动词

* The work finished, the rabbit went home. = The work was fined, and/so the rabbit went home = after the work was finished, the rabbit went home
* The weather permitting, the rabbit will go out = the weather permitting, the rabbit will go out.


一个简单句除去核心谓语动词，其他动词转为对于过去分词或现在分词的用法语法上成为独立主格。





### 独立主格

像是：名词 + ---being--- +  ......  ，省略being

独立主格结构对从句的简化：

名词/代词+现在分词：

* If the weather permits, the rabbit will go out

  The weather permitting, the rabbit will go out

* Because the wolf invited him, the rabbit decided to go to the party, =

  The wolf inviting him, the rabbit decided to go to the party.

名词/代词+过去分词

* Because he w a s invited by the wolf, the rabbit decided to go to the party=

  Invited by the wolf, the rabbit decided to go to the party 被动关系 简化

​		wolf是invite的逻辑主语。wolf游离于真正主语rabbit之外

​		After the work was finished, the rabbit went home

​		The wokr finished, the rabbit went home.

* The rabbit is lying in bed and a carrot is still beld in his hand

​		The rabbit is lying in bed, a carrot still held in his band

名词/代词+动词不定式：表将要发生的动作

* The rabbit to come, the wolf is overjoyed

名词/代词+名词

* Many animals went to the party, some of them rabbits and wolves

名词/代词+从容词

* Many animals went to the party, some of them happy

名词/代词+副词

* The rabbit sat on a chair, head down

名词/代词+介词短语

* The rabbit came in, carrot in hand

With + 宾语+宾补  就是独立主格结构

* The work finished, the rabbit went home

  With the work finished, the rabbit went home.

* The rabbit came in, with a carrot in his hand

  The rabbit came in, carrot in hand

  * may/might, 

    * 表达请求或许可：may/might I borrow your book? Yes, of course. might 比may更礼貌

  * be going to, be about to, be to

  * had better
    * 最好作，有忠告警告之意
