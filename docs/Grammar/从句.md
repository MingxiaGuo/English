## 形容词从句/定语从句/关系从句

形容词从句的思维方式：

* 中文：这兔子在吃一根我买来的胡萝卜。 中文的定语都是前置的

* 英文：这兔子在吃一根胡萝卜 ([胡萝卜的**关系词**]我买)。  英文从句做定语都是后置的

英语从句的构成：关系词引导形容词从句

* 关系代词引导的形容词从句: 

  * The rabbit is eating a carrot **that** I bought.
  * The teacher **who** ate a carrot is a rabbit
  * The teacher **whom** I saw yesterdat is a rabbit
  * The teacher **whose** favorite food is carrot is a rabbit
  * The food **which**/that the teacher likes is carrot. 

  * 关系代词 that 和which经常可以互换，先行词是明确的唯一的可以用that，先行词很多个同类事物中按限定条件选择 不一定用that，也可以用which。The rabbit ate a carrot which/that I brough.

* 关系副词引导的形容词从句: 关系副词=介词+which
  * This was the place **where** / (at which) the rabbit ate the carrot 关系副词转为关系代词: where换成at which
  * This is the reason **why**/(for which) the rabbit ate the carrot
  * That was the day **when** /(on which) the rabbit ate the carror for the first time.

* 限定性形容词从句
  * The rabbit ate the carrot which was on the table. 限定carrot的范围/性质
* 非限定性形容词从句
  * The rabbit ate the carrot，which was on the table. = The rabbit ate the carrot, the carrot was on the table. which替代t he carrot，避免重复
  * I have a head which is round
  * I have a head, which is round
  * 非限定性形容词从句做插入语
    * my head, which is big, is useful when it rains
    * The biggest carrot, which the rabbit ate, was on the table.
  * 非限定性形容词从句指代整句话
    * The rabbit ate the carrot, which was not surprising.

## 名词从句

**that** 经常做从句的引导词

### 主语从句

主语从句需要引导词开头

The fact is obvious

That the rabbit ate a carrot.

That the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious. that是从属连词

在问句中：疑问代/副词；引导词是连接代/副词

* Whether the rabbit ate the carrot  is obvious
* Where  the rabbit ate the carrot  is obvious
* When  the rabbit ate the carrot  is obvious
* How  the rabbit ate the carrot  is obvious
* Who  ate the carrot  is obvious
* What the rabbit ate  is obvious

形式主语

* That the bungry rabbit had alrady eaten a carrot for dinner this eneving is obvious.
* It is obvious that the bungry rabbit had alrady eaten a carrot for dinner this eneving
* It is obvious whether the rabbit ate the carrot 
* It is obvious where  the rabbit ate the carrot
* It is obvious when  the rabbit ate the carrot

* It is suggested that you (should) eat a carrot. 带有动词虚拟语气的主语从句 = That you (should) eat a carrot is suggested. 句子的谓语动词是suggest，demand，insist，order，从句的动词要使用动词的虚拟语气，这个动词的被动态也可以换成某些形容词照样用虚拟语气：It is important/essential/necessary that you (should) eat a carrot.

### 宾语从句

除了某些介词参与的情况，从句的引导词基本都在从句开头，从他词遵照陈述句语序

确定信息作宾语从句

* I saw **that** the rabbit ate a carrot. 宾语从句的引导词that可以省略
* 有时候不可省略that: 
  * I didn't know **that** the rabbit ate the carrot and **that** you saw it. 
  * I know, just like you do, that the rabbit ate the carrot.

不确定信息作宾语从句 whether, who, what, where, when how 不可省略

* I saw **whether** the rabbit ate the carrot.
* I saw **who** ate the carrot.
* I saw **what** the rabbit ate
* I saw **where** the rabbit ate the carrot.
* I saw **when** the rabbit ate the carrot.
* I saw **how** the rabbit ate the carrot.

某些词后的宾语从句的否定: 否定加在谓语动词前，而非从句中

* I think (that) the rabbit is smart
* I **don't** think (that) the rabbit is smart

主从时态一致: 主句时态=宾语从句时态

* I don't think that you're right ----  I didn't think that you were right

* I knew that the rabbit liked carrots
* 只有不变的客观现象才是例外：I knew that sun rises in the east.

be + 形容词 + that: 宾语从句？同位语从句？状语从句？归类为宾语从句的理由是形容词通常表达某种看法/判断，that引导的从句相当于看法/判断

* I'm sure that there's a carrot on the table.=  I confirm that  there's a carrot on the tabl
* I am happy that there's a carrot on the table.= I like that there's a carrot on the table

### 表语从句

I am a rabbit.   主语+连系动词+主语补语。主语补语=表语

The carrot tastes good.

引导词：that，whether, what, where, when , how

系动词是be动词

* The problem is **that** the rabbit is hungry.
* The reason is **that** there's no more carrot
* The question is **whether** the rabbit is hungry
* The question is **what** the rabbit should eat
* The question is **where**/**when**/**how** the rabbit should eat the carrot.

系动词是非be动词

* It seems that the rabbit is hungry

* It feels that you're not telling the truth

### 同位语从句

从句充当同位语，这样的从句在句中修饰抽象的名词

My teacher, Papa Rabbit, likes carrots

I like my teacher, Papa Rabbit.

The fact **that** the rabbit ate the carrot did not surprise me. 有引导词就不需要用逗号隔开。

The question **whether** the rabbit will eat the carrot is on all our minds

I have no idea **who** eat the carrot

I'm sure that there's a carrot on the table 有争议 宾语从句？同位语从句？状语从句？

I'm sure of the fact **that** there's a carrot on the table 同位语从句

### 宾语补语从句

​      5大类动词：                        5大类句型

* 不及物动词                         主语+动词
* 单及物动词                         主语+动词+宾语
* 双及物动词                         主语+动词+间接宾语+直接宾语
* **复杂及物动词                     主语+动词+宾语+宾语补语**
* 连系动词                             主语+动词+主语补语(表语)

需要宾语补语的动词：call, make, consider ....

You can call me Papa Rabbit

You can call me what you like.

my education made me who I am today.

宾语补语从句不一定是名词性质也可能是形容词性质。
