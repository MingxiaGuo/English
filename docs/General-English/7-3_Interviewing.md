I was so nervous! I mean, at the job interview last week.

When I arrived at the office, I was told to wait in this big room. All the other people who were there to apply for the job, all the other candidates, were waiting in this room. Fifty or more people and not a word was spoken.

Anyway, finally it was my turn. There were three interviewers. They asked a lot of questions. A man who looked like the boss asked the most difficult ones. One question, which I had no idea how to answer, was about me. Why did I think I was suitable for the job? I hate those kinds of questions!

ANyway, I got the job. That's imprtant thing. I was given the chance. I'm going to work for an organization called Houses for Homeless. Last year, more than 10,000 people were given homes by this organization. I'll start off in the office but, after a few years, who knows?
One step at a time, though, right?
```

#### b) Grammar: Past perfect

过去完成时

使用过去完成时，表述两件过去事情发生的先后顺序。过去完成时由 **had +** 动词过去分词组成。**Had** 的缩写形式为 **'d**。注意以下例句中事情发生的顺序。

* **She'd** already **applied** for the job when she saw the terrible salary.	在看到糟糕的薪水时，她已经申请了那份工作。

句中含有 **before** 或 **after** 之类的时间连接词时，由于时间关系已经很清楚，因此不一定使用过去完成时。在这些情况下，你可以使用一般过去时。

* He sent his resume **before** he went to the interview.	去面试前，他先寄送了自己的简历。
* He flew to New York **after** he got the job.	他在找到工作后飞去了纽约。

----

* I'd seen the job advertisement in the newspaper and sent in my resume.
* They'd hired him, then checked his references.
* The interviewers discussed her suitability after she'd left the office.
* The interviewer asked him the same question after he had already answered it.
