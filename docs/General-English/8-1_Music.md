I mean... I like music, I listen to it almost every day.
You know, I often listen to... Beethoven... If I'm sad or moody... If I feel like I need to relax, I'll put on some soft pop music, like Celine Dion.
I mean, I agree, it's, it's nothing special or... or terribly original, but you have to admit she has a great voice.
She... she sings beautifully.
Something special about her.

[B]: I just don't care... whether the music's cool or not. If it's right for the mood I'm in, then it's right for me.

Illegal Music
By Jacki Mistry

More and more people are buying digital music, but companies are still making less and less profit. That's because music is often illegally downloaded from the internet. Songs are shared for free between people's computers – no one pays for them. "It's a serious problem for the music business," said Dan Coates, CEO at myTurn, an online music service.

In the 1990s, sales were supported by CDs. "But no one buys CDs anymore," says Coates.

To help stop illegal downloading, companies like myTurn are offering music subscriptions. The companies believe that if an inexpensive subscription is offered, people will be less interested in illegal downloading. Subscriptions are from $10 to $20 a month, and they're getting cheaper and cheaper.

I just heard a song by Chanti Smith called 'Walking on Clouds.' What a beautiful song! First, Chanti sings quiet, low notes. Then the melody changes, and she sings the high notes a little louder. She has a great range and lightly hits the high notes. You can't really dance to 'Walking on Clouds' because there isn't much of a beat. But the song has a relaxing mood with romantic lyrics. It made me think about how my boyfriend Logan and I first met. Anyway, you should listen to it. I really enjoyed it.

I just listened to the song 'Home Improvement' by Josh Woodward. It's a folk-rock tune, and I think it's pretty catchy. I listened to it five times, and I can't get it out my head. Josh's voice is rough and edgy. He doesn't have much of a range, but he hits a few high notes. I was also a little confused. The mood of the song is kind of happy because of the quick, addictive beat. But I think that the lyrics are political, sad and sentimental. Very interesting! I recommend this music when you want a beat and some politics in one song.

I just heard a song by Josh Woodward called 'Home Improvement'.  What a beautiful song!. Josh sings quiet, low notes. He doesn't have a great range. His voice is edgy. The song has a quick, addictive beat and a great melody. The tune is pretty catchy. The lyrics are sad because the author likes his home the way it was before. But it also gives me a warm feel. It made me think about my home and my childhood. There's not much of a change in mood. It's all rough and edgy. But that's why I like it. Very interesting! Anyway, you should listen to it. I really enjoyed it.
