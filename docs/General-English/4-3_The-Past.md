  B: Really? I'm so glad!	真的吗？我非常高兴！

  A: Yeah!	是啊！

* A: That restaurant wasn't very good. 那家餐馆不是很好。
  B: No, it wasn't! The meat tasted bad, and the salad wasn't fresh. And the waiter was awful! His clothes were dirty! 是啊，不怎么好！肉有味道，沙拉也不新鲜。而且服务员也很差劲！他的衣服很脏！

#### d) Reading: Previewing a news article

预览新闻文章

随着你的英语更加熟练，你将开始阅读难度更大的文字，比如新闻和杂志文章。这时培养理解这些文字的策略很重要。一种有用的策略是在开始阅读故事前先预览或通看整篇文章。以下是一些具体步骤，将让你的阅读更加具有效率。


标题

标题以一种特有的简短英语形式撰写，因此起初可能会难以理解。例如，标题 U.K., U.S. Talk Trade 表示英美两国协商贸易问题。由于标题涵盖文章大意，尤其应该引起你的注意。


照片和插图

照片和插图置于文中，可以让文章更容易理解，增加阅读趣味。慢慢仔细观看照片和图片。如果图片配有文字说明，阅读这些说明，获取更多有关图片和故事的信息。

 导语

新闻文章的第一段称为导语，通常包含该新闻最重要的细节。导语常常引出人物、时间、时间和地点，有时也会介绍方式和原因。由于导语信息充分，因此你应该密切关注。


新闻来源

在文章上方，你可能看到至少下列一项：署名行（记者姓名）、日期栏（记者发稿的城市）和通讯社的名称。有时通讯社的名称见于括号中 (Global News)，有时缩写为 (GN)。

* **How was Jane's backpacking trip?**

#### c) Expressions: Active listening

**积极聆听**：听故事不应该完全被动接受。与通常的对话相同，你应避免沉默，激发讲故事的人，不懂得时候要提问。做一个积极的聆听者。

常常可以通过询问故事接下来的事情来激发讲故事的人。使用下列表达询问之后发生的事情：

* And then what happened?	然后发生了什么事？                            
* What happened next?	接着发生了什么事？
* What did you do then?	然后你做了什么？
* Go on.	继续讲。

请记住，升调可以将陈述句变为疑问句。使用类似下面的问题确定你理解了或表达惊奇。

* Bears?	熊吗？
* A problem with a bear?	碰到熊了吗？ 
* And we're going to the same place?	我们打算去同一个地方吗？     

最好的故事会故事讲述人和听故事的人应该互动，从而营造一场难忘的活动。
