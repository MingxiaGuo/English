### 9-2-1 Preparing for a negotiation 

```
A: OK, let's get started. The purpose of this meeting is to talk about upgrading our computers. We also need to prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the vendor
B: Yes. Nancy Keagan from Compunow. I think Compunow has the kind of computers we need, and at a resonable price.
A: So let's make sure we're all on the same page regarding quantities and cost, Todd?
C: I except we'll need about 35 new laptops over the next 12 months, I want laptops so that people can move around and talk to each other more.
B: That's a great idea. It's noisy in the office sometimes. If people can move to a quieter area, they can be more productive.
A: SO how many computers do you need, Simon?
B: I anticipate my team will need 15 desktop computers in the next year. Compunow's SF-36 would be perfect. It does a great job with large derabses, and doesn't often slow down or crash. 
A: I see. So, altogether, yoou two foresee a need for 50computers over the next year. Um, Todd, have you looked at Compunow's laptops?
C: Yes, and I talked to some people over at Sunset Computers. They love the PF-30s. They're powerful and reasonably priced.
A: Mm-hnm. How reasonably?
C: Well. Sunset bought theirs for 800 dollars each.
A: Hmm. That's a bit high. We need to negotiate a better price. SImon, how much are the SF-36s?
B: The standard model starts at 900.
A: That's quite reasonable.
B: But we need something with more memory and a larger hard drive. The one I want costs about $1100.
A: Let's umm, take a break. I'll have a look at the budget and see if I can make these numbers work, I'll come get you if there's a problem.
C: Ok, 
B: Sure

C: I chose the SF-36 because it's powerful, and it has a solid reputation for being durable. They're pretty much state of the art.
B: Yes, they're great computers.
D: I, uh, chose the PF-30. They use them at s Sunset COmputers. They love them because they're lightweight and tough.

B: ANd in your email, you said that you just need a basic laptop for your employees?
A: Yes
B: So, where did you get the price of $800 for the Pf-30 laptop? Our lowest price for those is $900.

B: Well, you have to understand, I have some limitations.
A: So there's really no way you can go below 900?

#### d) Final Task: Negotiating

```
您办公室需要一个新的计算机系统。您的任务是买50台PX-100的电脑，每台$700，最多付$750。和电脑公司的销售代表Adam Fairbanks谈判，尽可能为公司争取最大的利益。 请听音频并录制 正确的回答
A: So, what can I do for you?
B: I'd like to buy 50 PX-100 computers.
A: The PX-100, a good choice. 50 computers at the retail price of eight hundred dollars each will come to twenty thousand dollars.
B: I'm afraid we can't go as high as 800 per computer.
A: Well, of course, if you buy in bulk we can give you a discount, what if we reduce the price to sevent hundred and eighty dollars per computer.
B: Here's my counteroffer. How about 700 per computer?
A: I'm afriad that's totally out of the question, if we were to sell forseven hundred dollars per computer, we would hardly make a profit. 760 per computer is as low as I can possibly go .
B: To clarify, 760 is the best deal you can offer?
A: I'm free sell. it's a fair price, you won't find PX-100 for a lower price anywhere else.
B: What would you say if we offered you 750 per computer?
A: 750 per computer, we tried to drive outside of business, look, are you positive that can go hard? that's your final offer? 
B: Yes, the top price I can offer is 750 per computer.
A: 750 dollars is a lot less that we usually sell our computers for, but let me talk to my boss, give a back to you.
B: I understand. Why don't you get back to me next week?
A: All right, tell next week.

### 9-2-4 Closing the deal

B: I;m glad to hear it.
C: Me too. I've been talking with a few friends who use the PF-29. and they recommend it.
B: So, let's take a moment and review what we've agreed to so far.
A: Okay, This is what I have. Over the next year. IXW will buy 35 PF-29 laptops at $600 per unit, and 15 SF-36 desktops, at 1,100 per unit. The total of both purchases is $37.500.
B: Good! That's what I have too. Now, let's talk about the next steps. What about the, uh, ordering and payment process, and the service plan?
A: Well, it's simple. When you decide you want computers, you call me. After a delivery, we'll send an invoice, standard 30-day payment.
B: Okay
A: We offer a standard one-year service plan that covers parts and labor - no charge to IXW - and I'll send a contract for you to review in a couple of days. Just call me if there's a problem.
B: Well, I think that we're all in agreement. Nancy, it's been a pleasure working with you.

I'll never forget the first house my husband and I bought. It was very small, but we really loved it. The price was $240,000. We didn't have that much money, so we made an offer of $200,000. The owner made a counteroffer of $230,000. We said that we were sorry, but we just didn't have the money. We also told the owner how much we loved the house and wished her good luck. We continued to look at other houses, but couldn't find anything we loved. Then, suddenly, we heard from the owner. The house was ours for $200,000. I asked her why. She said that one other couple had offered more, but she decided to sell it to us because we loved the house so much. We were very happy in that house.
