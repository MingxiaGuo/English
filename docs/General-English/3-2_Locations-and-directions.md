```
1. Could you tell me how to get to _____? 是问去具体某个地方，像博物馆，酒店，或街道的标准句型。 

2. Where is the closest_____?  如果你不是问一个具体的地方，但需要找到附近的银行，地铁站，厕所，等等的地方，那么最好的方式就是用这样的短语"Where is the closest_____?" 

3. 人们解释事物所在地最常用的一种方式就是使用术语'blocks'。block 是在两个十字路口之间的一段街区。因此'the next block'意味着下个路口之后的那段街区，而three blocks ahead意味着在同一条街道上但过接下来的三个路口。 

   另一种表示距离有多远的方式即是使用象这样的短语'the third right'或'the next left'。因此如果有人说"Take the third street on the left"意思是你应该走过两个路口然后在第三个路口左转。 

   叫别人左转或右转的不同方式有好几种。'Take a left'，'go left'，'turn left' 和'make a left' 都代表同样的意思：左转。"Go around the corner"意思是在下个街道转身但不跨越。 

4. 用建筑或标志物的指向。"It's just past the bank"意思是如果你走过银行，你要找的地方就在接下来的几幢建筑物中。'Opposite'，'across from'，和facing 都代表同一个意思－在同一条街道上，但在另一边。
```

### 二．回答句型 --- 回答别人问路（指路）的表示方法：

1. 回答Where's the (nearest)…? 可用以下简单的答语：

   It's over there. 在那边

   It\'s behind the… 在…后面

   It's next to the… 在…旁边。就在…..隔壁。

   It's near the … 它在…附近。就在…..隔壁。

   It\'s in front of the … 它就在…前面

   It’s at the end of the street. 在这条街的尽头。

2. 回答Which is the way to…please? 和How can I get to…? 等问路的话时，可根据具体情况，将下列有关句子组织起来用：

### 三、有关语法注释：

1. It's only about ten minutes' walk. 那儿离这儿只有走大约10分钟的路。
   *  it常被用来表示距离，后面可以跟表示距离的名词短语，也可以跟“名词（表示时间）+ 名词（表示行走方式）”，要注意撇号的位置。例如：
      It is three miles to the lake. 这儿离湖有3英里的路程。
      My home is not far from here. It's only five minutes' walk. 我家离这儿不远，走5分钟就到。
      It is one hour' ride from Shanghai to Suzhou. 从上海坐车到苏州有1小时的路程。
      有时地方名称也直接做主语：The post office is two blocks away. 邮局离这儿两个街区的距离。

2. Simpson Hall is on the corner of Bellflower Boulevard and Atlantic Avenue. (T) 辛普森楼位于贝尔弗劳尔大道和大西洋街的街角上。
   * corner前可用不同的介词表示不同的位置概念，街道的拐角可用介词on或at。例如：
     * There is a post office at / on the corner of Smith Street and Beach Road. 史密斯街和海湾路的十字路口有个邮局。
     * The dog slept comfortably in the corner of the room. 那条狗在屋角舒服地睡觉。
     * I was about to cross the street when a car came round the corner. 我正要过马路，这时拐角处开来一辆汽车。
   * 街道的名称可使用avenue, street和boulevard。avenue指的是宽阔的林荫大道，尤其指美国城市里纵向的街道，与其交叉的横道称为street。boulevard也是林荫大道。

3. Then walk two blocks straight ahead until you come to Cherry Avenue. (T) 然后一直向前走过两个街区，直到切里街。

4. There's a bus stop across the street on the corner of Cherry and Bellflower. (T) 在街对面，切里街和贝尔弗劳尔大道的转角上有一个公共汽车站。
   本句中across the street意思相当于on the other side of the street。

5. Take a number 10 bus going down Cherry. (T) 乘沿切里街行驶的10路公共汽车。
   * 乘公共汽车, 火车, 电梯等都可以用动词take，如后面的例子：
         Take the elevator to the second floor.
         My brother is going to take a ship for Wuhan.
   * 分词短语going down Cherry是修饰bus的定语。down在这里是介词，表示“沿着”，常和along替换使用。请看本课另一句：Then turn to the right and walk one block along Second to the corner of Orange Avenue. 然后向左拐，沿着第二街走，穿过一条马路，到奥兰治街的街角。
         这句中的along也可改用down。又如：
         The boat went down / along the river. 小船顺河而下。
 6. If you follow these directions, you won't have any trouble. (T) 如果你按照上述指引做的话，到保 罗的寓所去是没有什么困难的。    

指路举例：请看下面这段文字：“走这条单行道，在第一个红绿灯时左转，那里就是Hemphill Ave. ，是一条双线道。往下走, 你会在你的左边看到一个加油站,。继续走50 码, 直到看到一个三叉路口, 右转, 经过二个stop sign，你就会碰到沃尔玛（Wal Mart）。邮局就在Wal Mart 的对面。而杨先生的家呢? 邮局后面就是啦。”现将这段话分解开来加以解释。

1. Take the one-way street. 走这条单行道. 
   One-way street 就是单行道. 尤其在商业区, 以亚特兰大和纽奥良为例, 其复杂的程度可以用进的去, 出不来来形容, 实在不是个愉快的开车经验. 

2. You will stay on the street for a while until you hit the first traffic light.  你会走一会儿, 直到你遇到第一个红绿灯. 
   ​Stay for a while 通常指五到十分钟的时间, 不会太久. 遇见某样东西, 可以用hit 这个字, 如hit the traffic light, hit the stop sign 等等. 而traffic light 也有人说成light, 或stoplight. 

3. Then take a left. 向左转. 
   ​向左转可以说成turn left, take a left 或是Make a left. 有时光讲take a left 不明确, 你可以加上路名, 明确地告诉人家要转哪一条路, 例如Take a left into Hemphill Ave. 或是Take a left onto Hemphill Ave. 

4. It will be Hemphill Ave. It’s two-lane traffic. 那就会是Hemphill Ave, 它是一条双车道. 
   ​指路的时候如果能够说出街道名称是最好, 所以通常我会把转到哪一条路的路名也指出来. 至于是几线道一般指路的时候则比较不会提及. 双线道是指来去各一个车道共二线道而言, 四线道就是four-lane traffic. 像亚特兰大的Interstate Highway 有些地方都是十二线道, 那就是twelve-lane traffice 够惊人吧. 

5. Come down Hemphill Ave about five blocks. 由Hemphill 街往下走约五个blocks. 
   ​英文这个部份跟中文有异曲同工之妙喔. 我们会习惯地说, 往"下" 走, 英文也会说come "down" 或是get "down", 这里如果只说Come Hemphill Ave. 听来是不是怪怪的? 至于block 指的是一块一块的建筑, 外国人在指路时很喜欢用block 作为计量的单位. 

6. You will see a BP gas station on your left. 在你的左手边你会看到一座BP 加油站. 
   ​指路的时候除了路名之外, 明显的地标也是有帮助的. 通常你可以指出一些明显的建筑物或是加油站来帮助对方. 加油站的英文是gas station, 有时会简称station. 

7. Keep going 50 yards before you come to a fork road. 继续走50 码, 直到你走到一个三叉路口. 
   ​继续往下走可以用keep going 这个字, 或是continue straight 或是keep straight 也很常用. Fork road 就是我们说的三叉路口. 那如果是丁字路口要怎么说? 你可以说, This road will dead end into 10th Street. 就可以表达出丁字路口的意思了. 

8. Make a right, pass two stop signs and you will run into a Wal Mart. 向右转， 经过二个停车标记（Stop sign），你就会遇到沃尔玛（Wal Mart）。
   ​美国人喜欢说You’ll run into it! 意思就是， 你会遇到的。他们也喜欢这么说，You can’t miss it!就是说, 你绝不会错过的。

9. The post office is just right across the street of it. 邮局就在Wal Mart的正对面。
   ​Right across the street of it 是个很重要的片语, 加上\"right\" across 表示出\"正\" 对面的意思. 还有一个很常用的就是在什么什么的旁边, 这个要用The office is next to it. It 代表之前已经提过的Wal Mart, 如果之前没有提及, 这里也可以直接说成, across the street of Wal Mart. 

10. Mr. Yang’s house is behind the post office. 杨先生的房子就在邮局后面.
