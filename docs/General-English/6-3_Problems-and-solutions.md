#### b) Reading: Reading for the main idea 

阅读找出大意

找出段落或文本的大意是一种重要的阅读技巧。大意是指梗概，不是具体细节。了解大意后，更容易理解文本。

你通常可以通过确定主题句来找出大意。主题句一般位于段首，但也可以出现在其他位置。

如果你不确定主题句，你可以通过用自己的话概括来得出文本大意。寻找重复的单词或观点来帮助概括。

确定大意时不可太狭隘，也不能太宽泛。一个陈述即便真实，但可能过于具体或笼统，不可能是大意。

 

 ```
Poor John. He has a lot of personal problems. His job is very stressful. At night he can't stop thinking about his job, and he has terrible insomnia. He has marital problems because he drinks too much. And he's overweight because he doesn't exercise. John needs to make some changes.
