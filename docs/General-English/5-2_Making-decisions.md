### 5-2-1 Comparing options

比较选择

您或许熟悉两种比较方法。一种是 than 搭配 more + 形容词，还有一种是像 bigger （更大）和 better （更好）这样的单词。

* Bangkok is more expensive than New Delhi.	曼谷比新德里更费钱。

我们也可以使用 as + 形容词 + as 的结构来进行比较。

这一短语常用于否定，它有多种构成方式。

* expensive – more expensive – the most expensive 	费钱的 - 更费钱的 - 最费钱的

其他的比较级和最高级构成方式不规则，必须背诵识记。

#### c) Listening: Understanding main ideas

听取主要思想

When you are listening to someone, the most important thing to understand is the person's main idea or decision. Look for the phrases you've just learned to indicate what the speaker's meaning is. For example, when you hear the phrase to be honest, you should expect disagreement afterward. When you hear I think that, you should listen for the speaker's opinion afterward. Listen to the speaker below. What venue does the speaker think is best?


Our discussion today was excellent! Thanks for all of your ideas. I've been thinking over what everyone said, and I've made my decision. To be honest, New York City is just too expensive. We don't have the budget this year. Paris is too far. Sorry, Marta! I think that Atlanta is the best place for our conference. It's the closest and much less expensive.

即使你不理解很多单词，你能理解最后的选择是Atlanta。
