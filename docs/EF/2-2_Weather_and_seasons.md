Betautiful day, isn't it?

Yes, it's not like what the radio said at all.

I wish it would stay this way for the weekend.

As long as it doesn't snow!

It seems to be clearning up.

It's such a nice change.

I really don't think this weather will last .

Let's just hope it doesn't get could again.

It looks like it's going to be sunny.

yes, It's much better than yesterday.

They say we're going to get some rain later.

Oh, let's just hope it stays warm.

I think it's going to be a nice day.

It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday.

But it's supposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon.

Well, the worst of the winter should be over.
