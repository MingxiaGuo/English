> 'The Artist' is just like one of those old films. This romance was made in gorgeous black and white and takes place in the 1920s. And, just like the old films, there's no talking. There are only a few subtitles. But it's certainly not a remake of one of the old films from the 1920s. Remember how some of those old movies had really bad acting? Well, the acting in 'The Artist' is brilliant, and actor Berenice Bejo is incredible. This movie also has an original plot. 'The Artist' shows us what happens when a famous person has really bad luck. I won't tell you how it ends – see 'The Artist' for yourself.

| I don't like baseball, but 'Moneyball' was a very interesting movie.  The story is a little dark. You learn some dreadful things about sports, but 'Moneyball' has a happy ending. 'Moneyball' is about the Oakland  A's general manager, the famous Billy Beane. Beane wasn't given much  money. He had to get creative. Billy Beane was played by Brad Pitt, and  'Moneyball' was directed by Bennett Miller. I think that actors always  do a good job when they work with Bennett Miller. | ![img](https://cns2.ef-cdn.com/Juno/11/16/95/v/111695/GE_5.5.4.3.3_baseball_player.jpg) **Runtime:** 2 hr. 6 min.  **Genres:** Drama |
