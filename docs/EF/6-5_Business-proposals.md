[JOAN]: The purpose of this meeting is to give you an update about IXW's purchase of Sunset Computers. I know you must have a lot of questions. Well, now is the time for answers.
[JOAN]: Let's start with the good news. Due to the purchase of Sunset, our market share in Asia has increased to 23 percent. And our revenue from the region has increased to nearly 25 percent. This is mainly because of Sunset's strength in China and Korea.
[JOAN]: However, sales in Europe have decreased slightly. As a result, revenue there fell by 8 percent, while sales in North and South America have been flat. Overall, revenue is up by 5 percent, but our costs have also risen. Consequently, our profits are going to decrease slightly.
[JOAN]: Let me assure you, we're not looking at layoffs to save money. But it is possible that we'll delay some projects. In the next few weeks, you will be working with managers to find opportunities to cut expense. Does anyone have any questions?
