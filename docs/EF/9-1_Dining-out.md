[Todd]: Yeah.
[Joan]: What kind of food does he like?
[Todd]: Oh, boy. He's really picky.
[Joan]: What - is he vegetarian, or vegan, or something?
[Todd]: No, but he only eats organic. When we ate out in the Stockholm, he kept asking the waiter all these questions. Were the vegetables grown locally, was the salmon wild, were the chickens free range - that sort of stuff.
[Joan]: I see.
[Todd]: Oh, and he's watching his weight, so he'll want fat-free everything.
[Joan]: How about City Chow? They're all organic, and the food's great.
[Todd]: Good idea, I'll make the reservation.
[Joan]: Great.

[Restaurant Employee]: City Chow. How may I help you?
[Todd]: Hi, I'd like to make a reservation for three people, on Wednesday night at 7 o'clock.
[Restaurant Employee]: Okay. Three people. Wednesday night at 7. Just let me check.

[Restaurant Employee]: Uh, would 7:30 work?
[Todd]: Yes, that would be fine. This is a business dinner, so, uh, we'd like a quiet table.
[Restaurant Employee]: That's no problem. I'll put you in the back dining room. It's very quiet there. And what's the name?
[Todd]: Billings. Todd Billings.

#### d) Reading: Eating in a restaurant

> **Culture Corner: Eating out**
>
> You sit at a comfortable table, and your server immediately introduces herself: 'Hello. I'm Julia. I'll be your **server** tonight.' Don't be surprised if the server gives you his or her first name. Most restaurants want you to feel comfortable, so servers are often **informal** but polite.

> ![img](https://cns2.ef-cdn.com/Juno/12/54/17/v/125417/GE_9.1.2.4.1_server.jpg)

> Your server will also ask you a lot of **questions** about your order – questions like 'How **would** you like that?' and 'What kind of **dressing** would you like on the salad?' After you start eating, your server may also come back to the table several times, asking, 'How is **everything**?' Don't worry; that's normal. Tell the server what you think, honestly and politely. The server wants to make sure you get exactly what you want and that you are pleased with your food.
>
> After you've eaten, you may still have some food on your plate. That's fine. Your server might ask 'Would you like to take that home with you?' If you do want to take the food home to eat later, the server will put the food in a package 'to go.'
>
> Finally, it's important to give your server a tip before you leave. Servers usually expect a tip that is at least 15 percent of the bill, but customers sometimes leave a 20 percent tip for excellent service.

#### c) Expressions: 

##### i) Politely interrupting

打断


打断别人说话时，要记住两件重要的事。第一，务必礼貌，使用 excuse me 和 I'm sorry 等类似表达。第二，在别人说完一句话再打断，不要在开始说一句话时打断。使用类似这样的表达来插话。

* A: I think that this fish is delicious! And …	我觉得这鱼非常好吃！还有……
  B: Excuse me for interrupting, but here's your salad.	对不起，打断一下，这是您的沙拉。

* A: I love this restaurant. I come here once or twice a month.	我很喜欢这家餐厅。我一个月来一到两次。
  B: Sorry to interrupt, but our movie starts in 30 minutes. We should leave soon.	不好意思，打断一下，我们的电影还有半小时就开始了。我们得马上走了。

使用类似下面的表达补充他人的观点，或者表述与之相反的观点。注意，这些说话技巧比直接打断要礼貌得多。

* A: Well, both the T-bone steak and the lasagna look really good. I can't decide.	嗯，丁骨牛排和千层面看起来都不错。我不知道点什么好。
  B: I'd like to add something. The T-bone is from a local farm. It's organic beef.	我想补充几句。丁骨牛排来自当地农场，是有机牛肉。

* A: I'm not sure that the Garlic Barn is the best restaurant for our business lunch.	我不敢说 Garlic Barn 是不是最适合我们的商务午餐的餐厅。
  B: May I say something? I ate there with friends last week, and it was incredible!	我可以说两句吗？我上周和朋友吃过，非常不错！

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| What does Olivia say before she asks about dessert?          | Excuse me … Sorry to interrupt.                 |

| Aiden says that Chad is the most negative person he's ever met. How does Chelsea interrupt? | May I say something                             |

----

* Sorry to interrupt. 不好意思，打断一下
* May I say something? 我可以说两句吗？
* I'd like to add something. 我想补充几句。

##### ii) Supporting someone's opinion

> AIDEN: Cool. We actually bought tickets to fly to Koh Rong, Cambodia. We can go diving in the morning and swimming at night.
> CHELSEA: Excellent. You should spend lots of time on the beach.
> AIDEN: Yeah, **I'm totally with you there**. All this snow we've been having is depressing.
> CHELSEA: **I couldn't agree more**. I'm ready to move to Hawaii!
> AIDEN: Hey, we should get a couple of sundaes to celebrate the project.
> CHELSEA: **I was just about to say the same thing** . Sundaes and espressos!

#### a) Writing: A restaurant meal

撰写正确的分句

用英语写作时，每个分句中都应用一个主语加上一个谓语动词。 尽管有例外情况，这仍是一个不错的经验法则。

* I recently ate at a really cool restaurant.	我最近在一家的确很棒的餐厅吃饭。
* We had drinks, appetizers, a main course and dessert.	我们喝了饮料、吃了开胃菜、主菜和甜点。
   	 

在带有一个主句和一个从属分句的句子中，每个分句都需要一个主语和一个谓语动词。

| **主句**                                                     | **从属分句**                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **We** **ordered** the perfect espresso 我们点了这杯完美的意式浓缩咖啡 | *when **we** **finished** dessert.* 当我们吃完甜品时。       |
| **Everything** **was** fresh and delicious, 每道食物都很新鲜和美味， | *so **we'll** probably **go** again.* 所以，我们可能还会再去。 |



**We** recently **ate** at a new restaurant called Bim's. I ordered the T-bone steak. I **asked** for mashed potatoes and a side of asparagus. It was wonderful! My **friend** got the lasagna. As soon as we finished our main course, we ordered bread pudding and cappuccinos. Both **were** excellent. **Everything** was delicious, so we'll probably go again. But first, I have to go back on my low-carb diet.



#### b) Expressions: 

##### i) Paying the check

买单

在将你的 check 或 bill 拿来之前，服务员会问你是否已用餐完毕。

* A: Would you like anything else?	你还想再要点别的吗？
  B: No, thanks. Just the check.	不要了，谢谢。 买单吧。 

你也可以告诉服务员你准备买单。

* Could we have the check, please?	可以麻烦你把帐单给我们吗？ 	 

用以下表达方式来提出买单和对买单的人表示谢意：

* A: The meal's on me.	这顿饭我请客。
  B: That's very generous. I appreciate it.	你真大方。 非常感谢。

注意在下列对话中这名男士是如何礼貌地拒绝、最终又是如何接受别人的好意的：

* A: I'll take that.	我来请。
  B: You don't have to do that!	你不必这么做的！
  A: I insist. You're my guest.	一定得让我请。 你是我的客人。
  B: Well, if you insist. Thanks very much.	好，如果你坚持的话。非常感谢。	 	 

文化说明：在商务聚餐 结束后，一方通知 会请客。但是在更多的非正式的场合，通常会平摊费用，有一个人会负责计算费用并告诉大家每人应该付多少钱。有时，人们会计算各自点的食物是多少钱各自买单，或者每人要求单独的账单。如果你不清楚该怎么买单，你可以问一下。

* A: So, how are we paying the check?	我们怎么买单呢？
  B: How about we each pay for what we had?	我们各付各的怎么样？ 	 	 

* A: Shall we split the bill equally?	我们AA制好吗？
  B: Yeah, good idea.	好的，好主意。
  A: That comes to, uh, 22 each.	每人共计22。
