#### a) Grammar: Negative tag questions 否定反意疑问句

反意疑问句是位于陈述句之后的小问句, 使用反意疑问句确定某事真假或征求同意。

用一个否定的反义疑问句跟在一个肯定句后。大多数否定的反义疑问句由**do + not +** 代词构成。注意，该动词常被缩写

* You got a degree in engineering, didn't you?	你获得了工程学学位，不是吗？
* You work in electronics, don't you?
* She can work well with others, didn't she?

* Lynn's great, isn't she?
* He was late, wasn't he?	他迟到了，不是吗？

* He isn't on our team, **is he**?
* They can repair computers, **can't they**?

* Miss Boyd is the CEO, **isn't she**?
* They weren't hiring, **were they**?

不肯定用升调，肯定用降调。

- The event lasted all weekend, didn't it?
- They can't serve customers in Asia, can they?
- Cory wasn't there, was he?

##### ii) 对话管理

您可以通过使用会话管理策略来增加成功对话的机会。使用这些短语表示您在回答之前正在考虑您想要说的内容：礼貌地让每个人都有同等机会说话。同时力求避免长时间的沉默。你可以通过完整回答问题来延长对话。

当你需要思考要说的话，使用类似表达：
* Hmm …
* Let's see ….
* Let me think.

要表示你理解了某人所说内容，示意他们继续谈话，使用类似表达：
* Uh-huh?
* Right. 
* Interesting. 

要表示你没有听清或理解某人所说内容，使用类似表达：
* I'm sorry, but could you repeat that? 
* Could you say that again, please?

Networking party about health costs

From: nick.stevens@upoweru.com
To: cassandra@cityhealth.com; joseph@healthykid.net

Hi, Cassandra and Joe.
I went to a fantastic networking party this weekend at the General Hospital in Luxembourg. More than 20 city healthcare executives were there. The executives shared great ideas about how to decrease healthcare costs. The best idea was probably a free health advice website. People seemed excited about my course for doctors, too.
I'll tell you more when I see you next week!

Best regards,
Nick
