Subject: Your questions about the company
 
Hi, Jessica.
 
Thanks for your email. I've provided answers to all of your questions.
The answer to your first question about the environment is that it's a pretty serious work atmosphere. All employees have to wear business attire every day, and everyone has their own cubicle.
In answer to your final question about work-life balance, most people here work 40 hours a week, more or less.  I get about three weeks' vacationeach year. And yes, people here do socialize together sometimes. The area around the office is great for eating and shopping, and there are plenty of places to have lunch.
 
See you soon!
 
Jessica

Dear Jessica, 
Thanks for your email. I've provided answers to all of your questions. The answer to your first question about the company culture and the office environment is that it's a pretty casual place.  The atmosphere is fun. There are approximately 13 employees. Most people here work 40 hours a week. We're all friends, and we like to spend time together outside the office. We go out to dinner two times or so a month. I get about two weeks' vacation per year. Last year I went to beijing with some other colleagues. It was amazing!
Thank you
Michelle
