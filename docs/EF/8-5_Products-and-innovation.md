购买

付钱购买某种产品的过程在不同国家可能不同。 以下是在美国购物时的一些注意事项。

如今，很少有人在购物时开 checks。 Cards 和 cash 快捷方便。 务必明白，debit cards 和 credit cards 大不相同。 使用 debit card 时，直接从银行账户扣钱。 使用 credit card 时，你将从某个金融机构借钱，而且将来必须偿还这笔钱。


税

美国大多数州都有 sales tax，即为政府征收的金额。 销售税为购买价格的一定百分比。

退货

购物时，你应询问商店的 return policy，即退还你不需要的物品的规则。 退货通常有时间限制，如 30 天，某些物品可能不可退货。 若要退货，你必须持有 receipt，这张纸表明了价格以及你是在该商店购买的该物品。 商店通常会向你提供 refund，即你为物品支付的款额。
