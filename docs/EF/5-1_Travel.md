The bad news is that I've still  got terrible jet lag after my 26-hour flight on Monday. The good news is that, yesterday, I hiked the red coast of Tasmania. It is the most beautiful place I've ever  camped, and the night sky is gorgeous. I've been  to the Atacama Desert in Chile. I've visited  Valentia Island in Ireland. And I've traveled in Australia before, but I've never seen  so much light in the night sky. Tonight, I'll have to go for a walk and look for Tasmania's special animals, like wombats and kangaroos – I haven't seen  any of them in the wilderness yet.
