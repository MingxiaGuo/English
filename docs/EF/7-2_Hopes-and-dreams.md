From: timmy@koolmail.com

To: momndad@zmail.com

Dear Mom and Dad,

This is a very exciting time for me. I'll be graduating next month with my degree in engineering. Dad, I know it's your dream for me to get a job with a big engineering company. Honestly, I'm just not sure that's what I want to do. Mom, I know you're hoping that Julie and I will get married, but it's not the right time. Maybe in a year or two.

My dream is to see the world and use my degree to help people. That's why I'm applying to the Peace Corps. I hope that I can make a difference in some people's lives. If the Peace Corps accepts me, I'd like to work on water projects. People need clean water.

Well, I guess that's it for now. Thank you both for all your help. Talk to you soon.

Love,

Tim

* Whe is Tim graduating?
