#### b) Reading: Travel tips

Read the web article with travel tips for dealing with airline delays. Select the correct answer.

> **Tips for flying**
>
> If you fly anywhere these days, you have probably experienced the unfortunate situation of a canceled flight. Here are some tips on how to deal with this increasingly common airline experience.
>
> \1. Plan ahead. If possible, try to fly nonstop.
>
> \2. Fly early in the day. If your flight is canceled or delayed, you have more options for being rebooked on a later flight. If you are on one of the last flights of the day, you will be in trouble if that flight is canceled.
>
> \3. Pack lightly. If possible, just have carry-on baggage. It's much easier to reschedule a flight if you haven't checked bags.
>
> \4. Have your airline phone numbers stored on your cellphone. This is very important because the first thing you want to do when you hear your flight has been canceled is to call the airline immediately. Of course, everyone else will also be calling, so expect to be placed on hold. If your flight is canceled due to inclement weather, many flights may also be canceled, and the call center representatives will be flooded with calls. But if you are placed on hold, just wait patiently.
>
> \5. Get in line to rebook, as suggested by the airline, but stay online with the airline call center. Talk with whomever can take care of you first. Also, some airports have special kiosks for self-service rebooking.
>
> \6. Be polite to the ticket agent or call center agent. Your problem isn't the fault of that person. You can even say something like 'I know it's not your fault, but I'm not happy right now because …' Rude or demanding passengers will likely end up with less. This is a situation where politeness can make all of the difference.
>
> \7. Regulations about what airlines are required to offer customers vary widely. However, in general, if the situation is beyond the airline's control (weather, air-traffic delays), you probably won't be offered compensation or assistance. If the situation is within the airline's control (maintenance problem, lack of a flight crew), you probably will be given some compensation, like meal or hotel vouchers. Remember, though, it never hurts to ask for assistance, as long as you ask politely.

#### b) Grammar: Reordering sentences for emphasis

**变换语序加强语气**

有时说话人和作者希望把注意力集中在某件事或某个观点上。一种方法是变换语序。在有些语法书中，这被称为 **cleft sentence**（分裂句）。请看以下各例：

**以 'what' 起句**

* 比较这两个句子。注意第二个句子中重点在单词**love**上，而且它以单词**what**开始。
  * I love looking at modern architecture. 我爱看现代建筑。
  * **What I love is** looking at modern architecture. 我爱的事情是看现代建筑。

* 这些句子虽然复杂，但在英语中很常见。它们是强调句中某一特定部分的好办法。请看下面两对句子，一个是常规句，一个是变换语序后的句子，比较它们的强调程度。
  * It is interesting how the city has changed. 城市的变化是有意思的。
  * What is interesting is how the city has changed. 有意思的是城市是如何变化的。
  * I like the efficient subways in Tokyo. 我喜欢东京的有效率的地铁。
  * What I like about Tokyo is the efficient subways. 我喜欢东京的地方是它的有效率的地铁。
  * I'm interested in shopping. 我对购物感兴趣。
  * What I'm interested in is shopping. 我感兴趣的是购物。
  * What worries me is homelessness.
  * What's curious is that there isn't much trash.
  * What I am excited about is the river cruise.
  * What they love are the stunning views.
  * What bothers me are the slow buses.

Group the sentences according to whether they are regular or reordered for emphasis. Move the text to the correct categories.

| regular                      | reordered                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| I don't know what to order.  | What I noticed is all the trash.      |
| What are the museum hours?   | What I like is the vibrant art scene. |
| I'm crazy about jazz clubs.  | What worries me is the crime rate.    |
| I care about hotel location. | What I'm crazy about is rooftop bars. |

#### c) Writing: Writing about a city

**描述一个城市** : 一种描写一个有意思的城市的方法是使用各种描述性词语来表达你的感情。注意**-ing**和**-ed**结尾的词。以**-ing**结尾的词常常描述某个事物的特性，但是以**-ed**结尾的词描述感情。

* The homelessness in Tampa was **shocking**. 在坦帕无家可归的情形是令人震惊的。|The homelessness was **shocking**.     
* I was **shocked** by the homelessness in Tampa. 我对坦帕的无家可归的情形感到震惊。    
* I was **amazed** by the vibrant art scene. 
* There were some **amazing** monuments.
* I'm sorry to say it, but the trash was a little bit **disgusting**.
* The views were **stunning**.
* I hate to say it, but I was **surprised** by the poverty.
* 这些是几对描述性词汇。     
  * disgusted – disgusting 感到恶心的－令人恶心的
  * amazed – amazing 感到十分惊奇的－令人十分惊奇的 
  * disturbed – disturbing 感到不安的－令人感到不安的
  * confused – confusing 感到疑惑的－令人感到疑惑的
  * surprised – surprising 感到惊讶的－令人感到惊讶的

**弱化负面评论**

* 你不知道谁会读你的博客文章，因此如果你要说一些关于某人的城市负面的事情，你要做到**diplomatic**（圆通得体的）。一种方法是用复句开场来弱化你的观点。 

  * **I hate to say it,** but homelessness is a problem there. 我不太想说，可是无家可归是那的一个问题。     

  * **I don't want to offend anyone, but** crime was a problem there. 我不想得罪任何人，但是犯罪是那的一个问题。     

  * **I'm sorry to say this, but** it was disgusting. 我很难过说到这事，但是它是令人恶心的。      

* 另一个弱化负面观点的方法是使用像**a little**或者**a bit**的量词。
  * It was **a little** disgusting. 它有一点令人恶心。     
  * She was **a bit** disturbed. 她有一点感到不安。

> Norman, I basically agree with you that Barcelona is an amazing city, but there is one negative. The city has a high unemployment **rate**, which has caused a bit of an increase in the **crime** rate. I hate to say it, but if you're a tourist, you have to be careful about pickpockets. Of course, every large city with tourists has the same problem. Other than that, I think Barcelona IS one of the best cities in the world – magnificent **architecture**, friendly people and incredible food.

```

答案
I had a wonderful visit in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, last year. My husband and I had a great time. What I love about the city is its rich history. In the historic center of the town, there are monuments, churches and beautiful old neighborhoods. It's easy to walk everywhere, and the streets and sites are clearly marked. There is a vibrant art scene, with lots of galleries in a historic neighborhood. What is fantastic is the beach promenade. It's a wide pedestrian area with fantastic modern sculptures. Of course, the beaches are fabulous, and there isn't much trash.
