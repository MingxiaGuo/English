#### c) Reading: A traveler's blog

> The bad news is that **I've still**  got terrible jet lag after my 26-hour flight on Monday. The good news is that, yesterday, I hiked the red coast of Tasmania. It is the most beautiful place **I've ever**  camped, and the night sky is gorgeous. I've **been**  to the Atacama Desert in Chile. I've **visited**  Valentia Island in Ireland. And I've traveled in Australia before, but **I've never seen**  so much light in the night sky. Tonight, I'll have to go for a walk and look for Tasmania's special animals, like wombats and kangaroos – I **haven't seen**  any of them in the wilderness yet.
