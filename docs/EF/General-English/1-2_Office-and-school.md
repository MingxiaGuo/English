#### b) Grammar

##### i) Plurals

**Forming plurals**

To make most nouns plural, add an **s** at the end.

desk – desk**s**

office – office**s**

For words that end in **x, sh, s, ss** and **ch**, add **es** at the end.

class – class**es**

**Pronunciation of plurals**

There are three ways to pronounce the final s or es at the end of plural nouns.                               

| /s/      | /z/       | /ɪz/    |
| -------- | --------- | ------- |
| desks    | phones    | classes |
| students | computers | offices |
| Books    |           |         |
| Windows  |           |         |

##### ii) Quantifiers

**Basic quantities**

Use **there** is and **there are** to talk about the amount of something. The singular form, **there is,** is often contracted:

**There's a** book on my desk.	There's a book on my desk.

**There are** 12 students in my English class.	There are 12 students in my English class.


The expressions **a lot of,** **some** and **a few** are used to describe quantities. Use **a few** for three or four items. Use **some** for any quantity greater than one, but not for a large amount. Use **a lot of** to describe a large amount.



There are **a few** chairs in the kitchen.	There are a few chairs in the kitchen.

There are **some** computers in the office.	There are some computers in the office.

There are **a lot of** people in my company.	There are a lot of people in my company.

Notice how these words come in front of the noun they describe.



**There are** a lot of people in my office. There are **a lot** of desks, computers and chairs. There are a **few** meeting rooms and some restrooms. **There is** a kitchen, and there is a coffee machine. There are **some** big windows.

#### c) Final Task: Describing your office

**构成复数**

大多数名词复数都是在词尾加 **s** 。
 desk – desk**s**
 office – office**s**
 以 **x**, **sh**, **s**, **ss** 以及 **ch\*****结尾的单词要在词尾后加**es **。****
 \**class – classes\****

**复数的发音****
** **有三种方式发以**s **或** es** 结尾的复数名词的音。

| /s/            | /z/             | /ɪz/          |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| *desk**s***    | *phone**s***    | *class**es*** |
| *student**s*** | *computer**s*** | *offic**es*** |

 

 

**基本量**

请用**there is** 和 **there are**来谈论某物的数量。 **there is**的单数形式常常缩写成：

***There's a\*** *book on my desk.*

***There are\*** *12 students in my English class.*

**a lot of**、**some** 和 **a few** 用于表达数量。三到四个用 **a few**，数量超过一个用 **some**，但不用于大的数量。表达大的数量用 **a lot of**。

*There are* ***a few\*** *chairs in the kitchen.*

*here are* ***some\*** *computers in the office.*

*There are* ***a lot of\*** *people in my company.*
