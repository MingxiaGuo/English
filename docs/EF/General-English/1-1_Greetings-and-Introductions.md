<div style='background:; border-radius: 20px; padding: 2px 10px; border: 2px solid #FF9900; '>

* **Asking for and giving names**
  * To ask someone for their name, use the question word **what**.
    * **What's** your name?   What's his/her name?
  * There are two common ways to give your name.
    *  You can say **I'm** + your name. **I'm** is a contraction of **I am**. In speech, we use a lot of contractions.
      * **I'm** Joe.	
    * You can also use the expression **My name is** + your name. This is a little bit more formal than **I'm**.
      * **My name is** Ann.	
  * Culture note: In English, when people ask for your **name**, they usually mean your **first name**, not your family name.
* **When you first meet someone** 与人初次见面
  * When you first meet someone, say that it is nice to meet them. They will reply by saying that it is nice to meet you too. The word too means also.
    * A: **Nice to meet you.**	
      B: **Nice to meet you too.**	 	 	 	 	 
* **Saying goodbye** 	 
  * Use the word **goodbye** at the end of a conversation. **Bye** is a shorter version of goodbye. It is more informal.
    * **Goodbye.**	
    * **Bye**.
    * See you later.  I will see you later.
    * Catch you later

?> **Tip** Telephone，Mobilephone，Cellphone，Smartphone有什么不同？ phone是喇叭的意思,是指用电话听筒代表电话。  telephone有希腊语词头tele,远程的意思.可以远程传话的话筒就是电话。  由于在所有话筒中电话使用率远远高于其他话筒,所以在没有歧义的情况下可以用phone代指telephone,当然phone还可以代指mobilephone(手机)。   Telephone 指包括固定电话和移动电话。mobilephone指移动电话包括cellphone和卫星电话。cellphone指蜂窝移动电话。 https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/576786248.html?sort=11&rn=5&pn=5#wgt-answers https://www.zybang.com/question/5727678b99a63395497804c8036aaff1.html
