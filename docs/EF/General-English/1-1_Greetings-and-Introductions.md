**Asking for and giving names**

* To ask someone for their name, use the question word **what**.
  * **What's** your name? What's his/her name?
  
* There are two common ways to give your name. You can say **I'm** + your name. **I'm** is a contraction of **I am**. In speech, we use a lot of contractions.
  * **I'm** Joe.	
  
* You can also use the expression **My name is** + your name. This is a little bit more formal than **I'm**.
  * My name is Ann.	
* Culture note: In English, when people ask for your **name**, they usually mean your first name, not your family name.

**When you first meet someone** 与人初次见面

* When you first meet someone, say that it is nice to meet them. They will reply by saying that it is nice to meet you too. The word too means also.
  * A: Nice to meet you.	
    B: Nice to meet you too.	 	 	 	 	 

**Saying goodbye** 	 

* Use the word goodbye at the end of a conversation. Bye is a shorter version of goodbye. It is more informal.

  * Goodbye.	

  * Bye.

### 1-1-4. Greetings

#### a) Grammar: 

##### i) Negatives of 'be'

**Negatives of 'be' 'be'的否定式**： Use the word not to make negative sentences with the verb be. The word not comes after the verb be.

* I am a student.
  I am not a student.

* He is busy. 
  He is not busy. 

* They are neat.  
  They are not neat.  

 **Negative contractions with 'be'**： There are two ways to make negative contractions for be. The first way is to contract the subject pronoun and the verb be.

* I am not a student. 
  I'm not a student. 

* She is not neat.    
  She's not neat. 

* We are not teachers.   
  We're not teachers.

 The other way is to contract the verb be and the word not. This is not possible with the subject pronoun I.

* He is not a student.   
  He isn't a student.

* They are not new students.  
  They aren't new students.  

##### ii) questions with the verb 'be'

**Questions with 'be'**: To make yes-no questions with be, move the verb to the front of the sentence. Remember to put a question mark ( ? ) at the end of a question.

| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| He is a student. | Is he a student? |
| They are new     | Are they new?    |
| You are busy.    | Are you busy?    |

​                     

**Short answers for yes-no questions**:  We usually answer yes-no questions with short answers that start with either yes or no and a form of be.

| Question         | Short answer     |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Is he a student? | Yes, he is.      |
| Is she new?      | No, she isn't.   |

| Are they busy?   | Yes, they are.   |
| Are they OK?     | No, they aren't. |

**Questions with a question word**: Some questions begin with a question word, like how or what. Notice that the question word comes first and is followed by the verb be.

* What's your name?
