#### a) Vocabulary

##### i) Review: numbers

**Numbers with '-ty' and '-teen'**

Some numbers in English sound very similar. These are the **-ty** and **-teen** numbers, like **eighty** (80) and **eighteen** (18). Notice how the first syllable is stressed in the **-ty** numbers, whereas the syllables are evenly stressed in the **-teen** numbers.

##### ii) Family

family, father, mother, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, grandfather, grandmother

#### b) Grammar

##### i) Simple present statements

**Simple present statements**

 

Use the simple present to state facts and habits. Look at the chart to see how the simple present is formed. Use the verb **+ s** after **he**, **she** and **it**.



| **Statements** |                |            |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| **subject**    | **verb**       | **object** |
| IYou           | come from      | Italy.     |
| HeSheIt        | come**s from** | Italy.     |
| WeYouThey      | come from      | Italy.     |

 **Simple present negatives**

To make a negative statement in the present simple with **I**, **you**, **we** or **they**, use **do not +** main verb. With **he**, **she** or **it**, use **does not +** main verb. Notice that the main verb doesn't change.

In spoken English, the negative **do not** is almost always contracted to **don't**. The negative **does not** is almost always contracted to **doesn't**.
 

| **Negatives** |                       |            |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| **subject**   | **verb**              | **object** |
| IYou          | **don't** come from   | Italy.     |
| HeSheIt       | **doesn't** come from | Italy.     |
| WeYouThey     | **don't** come from   | Italy.     |

 **Irregular verb 'have'**

 

For the verb **have**, use the form **has** for the third person – **he, she** and **it**. With the negative of **have**, the word **any** is usually used. When the verb **have** is negative, do not use the form **has**.

|      | *I **have** one brother.*            | I have one brother.            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
|      | *I **don't have** **any** sisters.*  | I don't have any sisters.      |
|      | *She **has** two sisters.*           | She has two sisters.           |
|      | *She **doesn't have any** brothers.* | She doesn't have any brothers. |

Networking



At networking events, it's important to try to meet as many people as possible in a short amount of time, so the conversations may be very fast. People want to find out quickly what others do, where they work and where they live to see if they have enough in common to have a longer conversation.



Common questions:

 





What do you do?                         What do you do?



What company do you work for?   What company do you work for?



Do you like your job?   Do you like your job?

Although it is not recommended to ask someone whether they are married or if they have children, it is okay to ask follow-up questions if they mention one of these topics.





A: I live with my wife in New York. I live with my wife in New York.



B: What does your wife do?  What does your wife do?



​    When you are talking to someone at a networking event, it's important to keep the conversation going. Even a short response is better than silence. Your responses can be positive, neutral or sympathetic.



Positive:

 





That's interesting. That's interesting.



Really? Really?



That's great!   That's great!





Neutral:

 





I see.                                              I see.



Uh-huh. Uh-huh.



Oh. Oh.



Sympathetic:

 





That's too bad.                         That's too bad.
