```
A: SO This is a meeting to talk about out market right? And how competitive, it's gotten
B: Yes. We only have 30 minutes, so we should get going.
A: Excellent, where do we start
B: Let's start with our strengths. What are they?
A: Our product quality we make the best accounting software in the industry.
B: That's a really good strength to have. Anything else?
A: In our small market in the UK, Our profits are excellent. We have almost 30% of the market here.
B: So, the UK is really good. How about in other places?
A: okay, so now we're talking about weaknesses in the rest of Europe, we're okay, maybe at 10% of the market but we have no presence in Asia Africa, we have a small office in the US.
B: So, outside of Europe, we sell very little. Let's move on to threats.
A: That's easy, Once we leave Europe we face the huge corporations like Pmniplex Mega Computers. They own their own software and spend millions of dollars in advertising
B: OK, so that's our threat. What about opportunities?
A: We have to find a big hardware company that needs software like IXW. They used to sell software but couldn't compete Now they just do hardware but they have a lot of money and a global presence. They're everywhere.
B: OK. That sounds like a good idea. Is that our next step?
A: I love that idea, They're really good company, I can give you a couple of names to contact over there
B: I'll follow up and summarize the results. Great meeting, everyone.
