  （不，我不行。）

See you soon.

你可以完全省略 in order，只用 to。事实上，to 使用更加普遍，在英语口语中尤其如此。


Courtney went early to avoid the crowds.	（Courtney 为了躲开人流早早就去了。）



你也可以使用 so that + 从句表达目的。如果位于主句之前，则在 so that 从句之后使用逗号，如果位于主句之后则不必使用逗号。

- Hi, Nicole!

  

- I'm in Mali now. Today, I'll take a tour to see Djenne.

  

- The city has a fantastic Monday market.

  

- I'm going to buy many beautiful clothes at the Monday market. I'll give some to you.

  

- Love,

  

- Megan
