### 7-4-1 Talking about your TV viewing habits

```
A: I almost always watch serious TV shows, like documentaries. And, uh, I never miss the news. Cable TV has a lot of great news channels. And I absolutely hate reality shows. People do such stupied things just to get on TV. Once in a while, when I visit my mother, I watch soap operas, but I don't really care for them. Oh, and, um, I watch a wather show every morning before I leave for work.

B: My job is pretty intense and stressful, so when I get home, I generally like to watch something light. You know - something funny, like a sitcom. I'm crazy about science programs, and I'm totally addicted to science fiction. I'll watch anything with spaceships in it! I also watch dramas, like crime shows or westerns. I seldom, or I should say never, watch game shows, Occasionally, I'll watch sports, like a football game, with my friend Jake. I watch a lot of TV. Sally calls me a couch potato.

I feel strongly that there should be a limit on how much violence is shown on TV. For example, lots of crime shows have killings, shootings and other violent crimes, all right around the time that families eat dinner together. In my opinion, this is not suitable for family entertainment. I don't think we should eliminate violence from TV altogether, but we need to move the more violent shows to a later time, when younger viewers are likely to be asleep.
