##### ii) Talking about a birthday

**Birthdays**

In English-speaking countries, people often celebrate birthdays by giving presents and having a party. The celebration can include a cake, sometimes with candles that equal the age of the person having the birthday. If you know it is someone's birthday, say:

* Happy birthday!                                

You generally do not have to give someone a present unless you are invited to their birthday party. People wrap birthday presents in colorful paper. Some older people may be sensitive about their age, so wait to be told how old they are. With younger people, this is not usually a problem.

Use the following question to ask someone when their birthday is:

* A: When's your birthday?                    

  B: It's September 21st. 

-----

* play computer games
