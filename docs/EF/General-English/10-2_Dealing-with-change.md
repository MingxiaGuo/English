### 10-2-1 Putting change in perspective

#### a) Reading 

##### i) Traditional values

**推论**: 做推论是一个很关键的阅读技巧。如果你不能推论出作者的意图，那么对于全文就可能理解不全面。这里是一些做推论的技巧。

**1. 使用图表。**

你将要读到的文章中有一张20世纪50年代美国家庭主妇的图像。以下是一些你有可能做出的推论：

* 上世纪50年代的家庭主妇是怎么生活的？
* 上世纪50年代的两性关系。
* 上世纪50年代至今两性关系发生了什么变化。

**2. Go from parts to the whole.**

从理解每个句子的中心意思开始，再结合各个句子的中心意思推断整个段落的中心思想。最后结合每段的段落大意更全面地理解整篇文章。

**3. 用主题句和过渡词作为提示。**

文中你将读到其中一段的主题句为'**是时代变了还是他们变了**？'从这句话你可以推断出作者想要：

* 比较过去和现在。
* 不认为事情的变化有我们想的那么大。

**4.寻找关键性的习惯用语。**

文中你将看到一段表达，'**他是家里的国王**。' 从这句可以猜出作者对于20世纪50年代的丈夫们的态度。

**5.谨防不合逻辑的推论。**

不要仅从一句话来推断作者的总体观点——通读全文再作结论。比如问句'**这是女权主义的终结吗**？' 有可能暗示作者认为女权主义已经不复存在了。但当你继续读下文就会发现作者有着更为复杂的观点。

It was 1950s America, and wives were expected to stay home and take care of the children. The traditional role: clean house, cook dinner, wash and iron the family's clothes. Most important, the wife was expected to cater to her husband's every need.

He was the king of the house. He knew how to make all the right decisions. He was strong, protecting the woman and children. He worked hard and was supposed to bring home a big salary to support his family.

Times have changed – or have they? Recent research suggests that more men and women these days appreciate traditional values. For example, some women still want a man who brings home plenty of money, whereas men don't always care if a woman is financially independent. Most women aren't interested in a husband who stays at home and takes care of the children, but many men do appreciate a woman who can cook and is a great mother.

Is this the death of feminism? Or perhaps this is simply the 'new' feminism, where a woman can be a mother, wife and have a career but still expects her husband to earn good money and do his fair share.

**Choose the two sentences that are true in the research findings.**

- The writer wonders if research shows more men are feminists. 

- Many men want a wife who is financially independent.

- Many women want a husband who is financially independent. Y

- Many couples want a marriage that is financially independent.

- The writer wonders if research shows feminism is less popular.

**Choose the two sentences that show times have not changed.**

- Many women want a husband who earns a good salary. Y
- Most wives still order the meal for their husbands.
- A husband still pulls out the chair for his wife.
- Some men still like women who can make dinner. Y
- A husband and wife still try to make each other happy.

Gender Talk

by Lisa Goldstein

Do men and women communicate differently? Professor Deborah Tannen believes so. Research by the Georgetown University language expert suggests that there are striking differences between the way men communicate and the way women communicate.

![img](https://cns2.ef-cdn.com/Juno/14/02/74/v/140274/GE_10.2.2.4.2_chat.jpg)Women use language to build and maintain better relationships, says Tannen. In other words, communication is a way for a woman to offer support to someone else. And it's a way for women to find agreement.

On the other hand, men use conversation to report information.Whereas women ![img](https://cns2.ef-cdn.com/Juno/14/02/75/v/140275/GE_10.2.2.4.2_meeting.jpg)try to find agreement, men use language to become 'king of the conversation,' or to 'win the conversation.'

Tannen also found that, when it comes to communication, many people think that women talk too much. Yet Tannen says that real conversations show:

| Women                                  | Men                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| may talk more in private               | may talk more in public               |
| sometimes speak at the same time       | sometimes interrupt                   |
| get fewer public opportunities to talk | get more public opportunities to talk |
| often offer understanding              | often offer advice                    |

Of course, it's questionable to say all women and men always communicate in these ways. However, it may be helpful for people to know about these perceived gender differences. That way, men and women might be able to avoid some misunderstandings.

**What is this article about?** A

- ways men and women communicate differently
- ways men and women communicate similarly
- ways men and women try to talk like each other

**Who is Deborah Tannen?** A

- She's a language expert.
- She is a communication psychologist.
- She is the person who wrote this article.

**According to the article, how do women communicate? **B

- by interrupting while others talk
- by encouraging people to agree
- by offering the best information

**On the other hand, men communicate _____.** A

- to offer information
- to start a relationship
- to interrupt while others talk

**Why did the person probably write this article?** C

- to criticize the way people talk
- to advertise her university research
- to help people communicate more easily 



Group the language behaviors according to the article.

 

Move the text to the correct category.

|  men | women|
| --- | --- |
|talk more in public|sometimes speak at the same time|
|sometimes interrupt|offer understanding|
|report information|build relationships|
|offer advice|talk more in private|
