#### c) Writing: Paragraphs

**Paragraphs 段落**

A paragraph is a group of sentences about a single topic or idea. You can have few or many sentences in a paragraph as long as they all relate to the topic. If you start writing about a new idea, start a new paragraph.

Paragraphs usually have one sentence that tells the reader the topic of the paragraph. This is called a topic sentence. The topic sentence is general, not specific. It does not give examples, facts or details. The topic sentence is usually, but not always, the first sentence in a paragraph. Here are two examples of topic sentences:

* My family is in very good shape.                
* Staying in shape can be fun.   

**The topic sentence** is supported by other sentences in the paragraph that give details and examples. Look at the sample paragraph. The first sentence tells you that the paragraph is about staying in shape.

* **Staying in shape is very important to me**. Every morning I ride my bike to work. I always eat a healthy, delicious lunch. I go to the gym two or three evenings a week. I have many friends at the gym. On the weekend, I play tennis or go hiking.

---

Read the two paragraphs. Choose the correct topic sentence for each paragraph. Remember that the topic sentence states the main idea of the paragraph. It's not always the first sentence.

> My name is Katy. I'm in pretty good shape. I love exercising. I go running every morning, and I do yoga two or three times a week. I eat healthy food, and I don't smoke. On the weekend, I go to the beach with my friends. We love playing volleyball.
>
> My brother's name is Max. He never **exercises**. He is in terrible **shape**. He **eats** fried chicken or pizza two or three times a week. He **never** eats fresh fruit and vegetables. His favorite desserts are chocolate cake and ice cream. He watches sports once or **twice** a week, but he never **plays** sports

Select the correct answer.

**Which sentence is the topic sentence?**

- I'm in pretty good shape.
- I eat healthy food and I don't smoke.
- My name is Katy.

#### d) Final Task: Writing about your fitness routine
