## 11-4-4 Summarizing an evening with a client

<video class="ets-vp " width="640" height="360" playsinline="playsinline" controls  poster="https://cns2.ef-cdn.com/Juno/19/34/42/v/193442/GE_11.4.4.1.1_POSTER.jpg" preload="none" src="https://cns2.ef-cdn.com/Juno/19/25/56/v/192556/MOB_11.4.4.1.1.mp4" style="text-size-adjust: auto !important; user-select: auto;"></video>

### a) Grammar: Reporting what people said

<div style='background:; border-radius: 20px; padding: 2px 10px; border: 2px solid #FF9900; '>

**Reported statements – past tense**

* 听这个男人描述一个麻烦的商业情形。 
  * I'm very frustrated. I feel like I'm getting the runaround. 我很沮丧。我感到我像皮球一样被踢来踢去。         

* 现在听这个女人转述这个男人说的话。
  * He **said that** he's very frustrated. 他说他很沮丧。|He said that he's getting the runaround.|She said that she's happy.|He said that he needs more information. 他说他需要更多的信息 |client said he was getting the runaround 客户说他像被踢皮球一样踢来踢去。 |He said he'd be unavailable all day. 他说他一整天都没空。
  * He **told me that** he feels like he's getting the runaround. 他告诉我说他感到像皮球一样被踢来踢去。 |He told me the deal was in danger. 他告诉我这笔交易有危险。|He told me that he was having lunch. 他告诉我他会去吃午饭。|He told me that he felt very frustrated.|He told me she enjoys team-building.|He told me that he's frustrated. 他告诉我说他感到沮丧。

  * I tried to tell him … 我试着告诉他…

**Reported statements – past tense**

注意，在转述的问句中，语序改回到主语+动词。

* What **are the latest numbers**? 最新的数字是什么？
* He asked me what **the latest numbers are**. 他问我最新的数字是什么。 |She asked me who the CEO is.        |I asked him what the problem was. 我问他怎么了。

**时态的使用**

在过去时态引用的陈述句和问句中，定语从句中的动词并不总是必须在过去。使用过去时态使动作具有完成感，而使用现在时则增加了即时性。看看这些例子。

* He told me that the results from last quarter **were** not good enough. 他告诉我上个季度的结果不够好。
* He said that our work on the project **is** not satisfactory.  他说我们这个项目的工作不令人满意。

 </div>

### b) Writing: Summarizing

<div style='background:; border-radius: 20px; padding: 2px 10px; border: 2px solid #FF9900; '>

**写邮件总结**
有时你可能需要给同事写一个邮件总结。可以遵循下面这个简单的格式。

1. 主题栏简洁明了。
   Subject: unhappy client  主题：不高兴的客户     

2. 解释写邮件的主要原因。
   **I'm writing to summarize** my evening with our client.  我写邮件的目的是总结傍晚我和我们的客户见面的情况。     

3. 列出所讨论的主要题目，包括问的问题和给的答案。
   **He said** he's not getting the information he needs.  他说他并未得到他需要的信息。
   **He told me** he feels like he's getting the runaround.他告诉我说他感到像皮球一样被踢来踢去。
   **He asked me** to straighten things out. 他让我把事情解决。      

4. 列出任何需要做的事情。
   **We need to make sure** our people give him the information he needs. Otherwise, the deal could be in jeopardy. 我们需要确保我们的人给到他他需要的信息。否则，这单生意有可能有危险。
        

这些是另一些适用于总结的表达方式：

* **To make a long story short,** he is not happy. 长话短说，他不高兴。
* **In a nutshell,** we need to fix things quickly. 简而言之，我们需要快点解决问题。
* **To sum up,** we need to be more forthcoming. 总而言之，我们需要更能提供信息。
