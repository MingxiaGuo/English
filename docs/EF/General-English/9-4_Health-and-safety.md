To: healthandsafety@govmt.org

Dear Health Inspector,

I just read your report on our coffee shop. I think it's outrageous. You must only have spent maybe 30 minutes observing us, and then you compile a terrible report. A score of six? Really? I'll probably lose my job for this, you know.

You even claimed one of my employees, Karen, was using dirty cups. Untrue! She's a new employee. I am her mentor, I observe everything she does, and she does NOT use dirty cups. Furthermore, you stated that we do nothing to protect the customers from coffee that's too hot. We always ask our customers how hot they want their coffee. I really don't understand why you were so critical.

I demand a review. Our coffee shop is not a six. Our coffee shop is a 10! And we have hundreds of happy customers who would agree with that.

Dan Heath

Manager, Downtown Coffee
