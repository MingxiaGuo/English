```
Carla,
 
I'd be glad to help you with the company's financial problems. Here are my ideas. First, I recommend offering older workers a big retirement bonus with medical coverage for six months. I think that about 100 workers would take the offer. Second, I propose that we stop all new hiring. We can use attrition to reduce staff size. I think that in a few months, we could cut our staff by about 40 workers. Next, we should cut the number of hours that everyone works to 35 hours per week. This would include everyone, even the big executives. Only as a last resort should we have layoffs. That would be very bad for company morale.
 
Sincerely,
Kim

* A: **In addition to** salary, the company will **also contribute** 500 a month to your retirement plan.     除了工资外，公司每个月还为你的退休方案缴纳500.

  B: Oh, that wasn't **in the offer letter**.     哦，那没有在聘用通知书上说到。|In the offer letter, there were no details. 在聘用录取书上，没有详细信息。|In the offer letter, there wasn't much information about benefits.

I would hate for this to be a problem. 我不想这样成为一个问题。

My current company deducts 400 dollars. 我现在的公司扣除四百美元。

The **proposed** salary is far below my current salary.

Your offer's about 15,000 below what I'm making now. 

I'm only paying 200 now, but the medical plan is probably not quite as good.

I'm sure we can work something out.

#### c) Reading: Negotiating benefits

Read the article about negotiating additional compensation. Select the correct answer.

> Congratulations! You've received a job offer, and you are ready to accept the offer. But wait. Before moving too quickly to accept, take some time to consider the **entire** compensation package. Remember, salary isn't the only compensation you will be receiving. Your compensation might also include **benefits** such as vacation time and a health plan.
>
> Employers often have more flexibility to negotiate benefits than a starting salary. Some benefits are the same for all employees, but others are **negotiable**. Here are a few other benefits you may want to ask about.
>
> **Hiring bonus**
>
> Companies will sometimes offer a hiring **bonus** to attract top candidates. It is a one-time cash payment that is made when you start the job. If the salary you are being offered is below what you expect, you may want to ask for a hiring bonus.
>
> **Vacation time**
>
> Although two weeks of vacation time is typical, you may be able to negotiate an extra week or two. This is especially true if you had more than two weeks of vacation at your previous position.
>
> **Relocation costs**
>
> If you will have to move for your new position, do some research into the cost of moving. Your potential employer may be able to help you with these **expenses**.
>
> Before you negotiate for additional compensation, research your options. Consider the salary that is being offered, plus the medical, retirement and vacation benefits for the total compensation. Then think about what other benefits you may be able to negotiate. Negotiate carefully and professionally. Asking for too much may cause a potential **employer** to reconsider the offer. But remember, it never hurts to ask.

```
A: I'd like to begin by saying we're very interested in hiring you but we do need to make sure we're on the same page regarding salary and benefits.
B: AYes, I have a couple of concerns about the salary.
A: I understand and I'm open to discussing any part of the compensation package.
B: My big concern is that your offer is below my current salary.
A: That's a reasonable concern. You wouldn't want to take a pay cut to come here. However, I'd like for us to look at the offer in terms of total compensation, not just salary. I believe that IXW has a much more generous compensation package than where you are now.
B: BThat may well be true. Could you give me some more details?
A: Certainly the best example is that if you join our if you become a member of our team will contribute $500 per month to your retirement fund. That's $6000 a year.
B: In the letter, it just said there was a retirement plan.
A: I'm sorry about that, it's a new benefit. what do you have to pay for your medical package in your current company.
B: They deduct 300 every month.
A: okay, so that's about the same as what you get here, That still leaves you earning more overall where you are now.
B: I would hate for this to be a problem. I really want to work here.
A: That's good and I really want to hire you, so to recap we offered you $70000 in salary. Now I need to talk to the CFO, but if we could raise our offer to 80000 that would clearly be more than you're getting tight now, would that be enough for you to accept our offer.
B: Yes, it would. As I said, I really want to work here.
A: Great, I can't make any promises. I'll see what I can do, It will take a day or two. Maybe I can call you on Friday, is that okay?
B: That would be good. I look forward to talking with you again.
