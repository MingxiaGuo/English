#### b) Grammar: Possessive pronouns and nouns

**Possessive pronouns **所有格代词

Possessive pronouns show ownership. They replace a noun. For example, **John's** can be replaced by **his**. Notice that possessive pronouns are different from possessive adjectives, which are used in front of a noun

![](/Users/guomingxia/Documents/Workspace/English/docs/EF/General-English/assets/prossessive-pronouns.png)

* That's **your** bathroom.
* **My** apartment is very new.

**Possessive nouns 名词所有格**

* Possessive nouns also show ownership. A possessive noun is often used in front of the thing it owns, just like a possessive adjective. Make a noun possessive by adding **'s** to it.

  * This is my **family's** apartment.  
* My **wife's** parents live in a beautiful house.
  * **Aki's** bedroom is large.
* My **friend's** garage is very small.
  * They're my husband's parents.

* To make a plural possessive noun, add an apostrophe **( ' )** after the plural s.
  * Her **parents'** living room has big windows.   Her parents' living room has big windows.

* For irregular plurals that don't end in s, add apostrophe **( ' ) + s.**
  * The **children's** bathroom is blue.      |

* To ask who owns something, use **whose**.

  * A: **Whose** beautiful yard is that?  | Whose bedroom is that?   |Whose parents are they?

    B: It's **ours**.   | It's yours, Steve. | That bedroom is **his** . | They're his | The big balcony is **ours** .

* Be careful not to mistake a possessive noun for the contracted form of the verb **be**. Example:

  * My **family's** apartment is large. (The apartment of my family is large.)  My family's apartment is large.
* My **family's** large.  (My family is large.)   My family's large.

> PETER: So, Li, this is your **family's** new house?
