#### b) Reading: Reading an events calendar

When you are looking for a specific piece of information, you don't always need to read the whole text. Instead, you can quickly scan through it for the details you want. For example, you want to go to a festival on the weekend, and you are looking at a list of local events:

\1. Find events quickly by looking for special typefaces – such as large, bold or stylized text – which often indicate key details.
\2. Look quickly through the list for the word **festival** (festival).
\3. Find dates and times by looking for numbers. 

Try these strategies with the sample online events calendar. Don't read every word. You should be able to quickly answer these questions:

* What festival is this weekend?  What festival is this weekend?
* What time is Tori Mitchell playing on Saturday? What time is Tori Mitchell playing on Saturday?

 

> What's Happening This Weekend
>
> Saturday
>
> Tori Mitchell
>
> Songs from Peru, played on flute by the lovely Tori Mitchell. 7:30 p.m. at the Music Space.
>
> Green Street Festival
>
> Every June, there's a lot of fun on Green Street. Enjoy food, music and clothing from 17 countries.
