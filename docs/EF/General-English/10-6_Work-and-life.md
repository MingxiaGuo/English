Dear Stan, 

It's so interesting to hear about all the changes in your life! My family life has changed quite a bit too. 
My son, Abdul, is studying to be a doctor. He wanted to try something new, so he moved to the UK for school. We decided against studying here because the schools are too expensive. 
My daughter, Tina, studied visual arts in Paris. She graduated already and has been living there since last year, but she's wondering if she should come back home sometime soon. We miss her a lot, so I hope she does!

Regards,
Jesse
