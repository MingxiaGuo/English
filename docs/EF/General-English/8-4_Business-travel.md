B: Yes, with Lindstrom. They're going to be late. This could be a huge problem for us.
A: But we've made problems to clients.

#### a) Grammar: Indirect objects

间接宾语：

英语中最常见的句子结构是主谓宾。

| 主语 | 谓语 | 宾语        |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Jack | sent | a postcard. |

在此句子中，a postcard 是直接宾语，因为它是谓语动词动作的接受者（由杰克寄出）。

有时，名词或代词并不是动词动作的接受者，而是直接宾语的接受者。 这被称为间接宾语。

| 主语 | 谓语 | 间接宾语 | 直接宾语    |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| Jack | sent | his wife | a postcard. |

在本句中，his wife 是间接宾语，因为她是直接宾语的接受者 (a postcard)。注意，该间接宾语位于动词和直接宾语之间

你也可以使用介词 to 和 **for*，在直接宾语后接间接宾语。

| 主语 | 谓语   | 直接宾语   | 间接宾语      |
| ---- | ------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| Jack | sent   | a postcard | to his wife.  |
| Jack | bought | a gift     | for his wife. |

以下是间接宾语的更多示例：

* I had to give the hotel my credit card number.	 	我必须向酒店提供信用卡号码。
* I showed the clerk my passport.	 	我向工作人员出示了护照。
* I showed my passport to the clerk.	 	我给那位接待员看了我的护照。
* The hotel gave my company a discount.	 	酒店向我公司提供了折扣。

当代词代替间接宾语时，我们称之为间接宾语代词。

* The hotel sent me a confirmation email.	 	酒店给我发了一封确认电子邮件。
* The clerk gave her the bill.	 	工作人员把账单交给她。
* The clerk gave the bill to her.	 	那位接待员把账单给了她。

---

* Please tell him that we're late.
* I sent the postcard to my friend.
* These trips cost her lots of money.
* They didn't reserve us a room.
* We paid $50 to the driver.

#### b) Expressions:

##### i) Expressing urgency and importance

表达紧急和重要

用此类表达来表达紧急：

* It's crucial that we find a solution.	我们务必找到解决办法。
* It's urgent the company find a buyer.	公司急需找到一名买家。
* It's essential that he attend the meeting.	他必须出席会议。
* It's vital no one discuss this information.	任何人不得谈论此信息。
* It's critical that we meet the deadline.	我们必须按时完成。
* It's imperative all staff understand the situation.	所有员工必须明白这一形势。

这些非常正式的表达通常后接动词原形。注意在这些例子中，并未遵循主谓一致原则：动词 attend 和 report 结尾并未后接 s。在此种强烈或情感的动词之后，第二个动词采用称为虚拟式的特殊形式。

* It's essential that he attend the meeting.	他必须出席会议。
* It's vital she report to us immediately.	她必须立即向我们报告。

用副词 absolutely 来加强紧迫感：

* It's absolutely critical that we meet the deadline.	我们绝对必须按时完成。
* It's absolutely crucial we find a solution.	我们绝对必须找到解决办法。

语言注释： 谨慎使用 absolutely、completely 和 totally 等修饰语；如果情况并非如你的用语那样紧急，你可能被责怪夸大事实。

---

* It's urgent that we give a response. 我们急需作出答复。
* It's imperative we meet the deadline. 我们必须按时完成。
* It's absolutely vital that she agree. 关键是她必须同意。
* It's absolutely essential that he understand. 关键是他必须理解。
