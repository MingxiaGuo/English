#### a) Vocabulary

##### i) Physical descriptions of people (people's apperance)

* Describe a person's body:  **人的外型描述**在描述人的身体时，我们通常会谈到身高和体重。需要注意的是，说人 fat 或者 overweight 往往被视为不礼貌的。不过在对人进行描述时，overweight 一词不礼貌的程度稍轻。
  描述身高和体重时，使用动词 **be**: She is tall and thin.	她又高又瘦。
	* height: 
    * tall  ｜She **is** tall and thin. ｜He is tall and bald. 他个子高高的，没长头发
    * medium height
    * short
  * weight
    * overweight (overweight is less offensive when describing someone.)
    * fat (it is generally considered rude to call someone fat or overweight.)
    * thin

  * arm:
    * size: long arms
* 当描述一个人的头发时，我们通常谈论长度，发型以及颜色。一个人秃顶我们就描述成 bald. 在描述人的头发时，我们通常使用动词 have。但是，如果某人是 bald，我们就会使用动词 be。
  * hair (1.length(size), 2.type(style), 3.color)
    * length: long, medium length, short
    * type: curly 卷发, straight,  bald秃顶(he is bald，特殊用be，其余都用have)

* 另一种描述人的方法是谈论年龄。Another way to describe someone is to talk about age(the topic od age is very sensitive):
