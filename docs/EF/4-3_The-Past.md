有些不规则动词的过去时和现在时截然不同，必须加以熟记。

* go - went  	        去

* bring - brought  	带来

其他不规则动词的过去时形式只是改变了一个字母，因此更容易识记。

* rise - rose 	上升

* get - got        	得到

一些动词的一般现在时和过去时的形式相同。

* cut - cut   	切割
* let - let 	让
* shut - shut	关闭

动词 read 的一般现在时和过去时拼法相同，但读音不同。请听这两句中 read 的读音。

#### d) Expressions: Changing a topic

改变话题


对话从一个话题转到另一个话题，有一些表达可以帮助人们暗示他们要改变话题。

'By the way'

使用表达 by the way 来引入新话题，它也表示你刚想起了某事。 


A: By the way, I saw Joe last night. He looked good.
B: Really? I'm so glad!	对了，我昨天晚上见到 Joe 了。他气色看起来不错。
真的吗？我非常高兴！

'That reminds me'

当你想起了想说的其他事情，使用 that reminds me 来转变话题。 

A: There was a great baseball game on TV last night.
B: Oh, that reminds me. I have two tickets to tonight's game. Do you want to go?
A: Yeah!	昨天晚上电视上有一场精彩的棒球比赛。
哦，我想起来了。我有两张今天晚上比赛的票。你想去吗？
是啊！

'Anyway'

使用单词 anyway 来结束或总结话题，这样一来你可以开始一个新话题。当你听厌了某人谈论某事，非常想改变话题时，就可以使用这个词。

A: That restaurant wasn't very good.
B: No, it wasn't! The meat tasted bad, and the salad wasn't fresh. And the waiter was awful! His clothes were dirty!
A: Anyway, we're not going there again. So, how's Jane?	那家餐馆不是很好。
是啊，不怎么好！肉有味道，沙拉也不新鲜。而且服务员也很差劲！他的衣服很脏！
总之，我们不打算再去了。对了，Jane 还好吧
