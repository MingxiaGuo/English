### 6-1-1 Giving feedback

```
A: Leo's my best friend. We've been friends for years. We went to the university together. I graduated from the university, and he didn't. He's worked at a pet shop since last year. That's one year of feeding animials, walking animals, cleaning animals. 

A: In the past, he's been a waiter, a gardener... I mean, there's nothing wrong with that, but Leo's really clever. He's reliable, outgoing, honest. He could do anything he wants. The problem is, he wants to do nothing. He's totally disorganized. He's just not ambitious. I'm the opposite. I graduated from the university and been working hard for the latest five years. I am ambitious. I have goals. Leo's never had a good job. He's never tried to find one. I don't understand it. I'm gonna find him a real job.
