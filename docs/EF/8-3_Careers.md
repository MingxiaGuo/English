```
A: I do want to save the world. I want to build green cities. If we don't change the way we live, and the cities we live in, we'll destroy this planet in the next 50 or a hundred years. Green cities are the answer to this problem. If we build houses from environmentally friendly materials, if we use natural power from the sun and the wind, if we recycle our garbage, if we plant more trees and open more parks, the word will be cleaner and greener. It won't be easy. But if my company could build one city - just one city - and people saw how nice it was, how clean the streets were, how fresh the air was, in five years' time we'd have a city in ervery major country. And after that, the world! Well, that's my plan, anyway. But you gotta have a plan.

```
A: If my father hadn't been so rich and so successful, ... If I'd had a normal childhood, maybe things would've been different. Maybe I would've been more ambitions, more interested in money. If only... Well, one thing I do know is that I don't want to be like my father. When he was young, my father dreamed of starting his own company and getting rich. And now his dream has come true. But is he happy? Mm-mm. He's been married five times. He works seven days a week just to make more money. He never stops. Now he wants me to join the family business, but I know if I work for my father, I'll never be happy. You see, my father's a planner. And he always achieves what he sets out to do - always. The trouble is, after he does, then he has to make more plans, then more. It never stops. My dream is simple: Do a job I like, meet a nice girl, get married, and maybe even have children. That's it.
