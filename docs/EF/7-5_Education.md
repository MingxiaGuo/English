### 7-5-1 Describing your educational background

```
A: I went to a public elementary school in New York City. I loved it. But when I went to middle school, the classes were big and my grades went down. So, for high school, my parents moves me to a private school. It was expensive, but the teachers were really good. Most of them has master's degrees or doctorates. After high school, I went to New York University. I received a bachelor's degree in literature. I really learned a lot, so it was worth it. At least, I hope my parents thought so.

B: I, uh, grew up in Coventry, in England, and I went to school there. I went on to university at Warwick, and studied for a joint degree in economics and mathematics. I did a BA in business management, then I did an MBA at the University of Michigan. It was challenging, leaving my friends and family in England to study in the US. I really learned a lot about American culture. Oh, and I became addicted to hotdogs.

#### a) Vocabulary: 

##### i) school vocabulary

**University 与 college**: 

在美国，college 经常为提供文科学历的一个单独的学院；而 university 则拥有多个学院（工程学院、法学院等）。美国人提及两者时均用 college，除非他们正在谈论某个特定的大学。 使用 university 时，通常在其前面加上一个冠词，如 the。

* I'm going to college in the fall.	秋天我要去读大学了。
* They both went to Pacific University.	他俩都去太平洋大学。
* We play on the volleyball team at the university.	我们在大学里的排球队。

在英国，college 通常是接受继续教育或职业教育的地方；而 university 则是攻读本科学位或研究生学位的地方。这两个词语通常均不与冠词 the 一起使用。

* I'm going to university in the autumn.	秋天我就要去读大学了。

* I went to college to study computer programming.	我上大学学习计算机编程。

在美国，学生们说他们 in college；而在英国，学生们则说他们 at university。

* Paul and his sister are both in college.	Paul和他的妹妹都在读大学。

* Paul and his sister are both at university.	Paul和他的妹妹都在大学里。



![](../assets/ef-education.jpg)

Most Americans start their education at age 5 or 6, in **elementary school**. Then they graduate to **middle school**, and finally **high school**. Each year of education is called a grade. Each school may be different, but grades 1 through 5 are usually elementary school, grades 6 through 8 middle school, and grades 9 through 12 high school.

After high school, students can choose to go to a university or college. **Universities** are larger than **colleges** and offer more degrees, like a bachelor's or master's degree. Colleges usually offer only bachelor's degrees.

Students can go to **public schools**, which are paid for by state taxes, or families can pay for their children to go to **private schools**, which some people believe offer a better education, but are usually more expensive.

* **What school is for the first five years of education?**

* **If a student is in grade 12, which school does he or she go to?**

* **What's the best school for a master's degree?**

* **What kind of a school is less expensive?**

* **When do most Americans probably finish high school?**

##### ii) University degrees

大学学历: 获得高中文凭 (high school diploma) 后，美国大学可为你提供众多普通学位，以下是其中的一部分。

* Bachelor of Arts	文学士
* Bachelor of Science	理学士
* Master of Arts	文硕士
* Master of Science	理硕士
* Master of Business Administration	工商管理硕士
* Doctor of Philosophy	哲学博士
* Doctor of Medicine	医学博士

在提及大学学位时，可以使用以下缩写词：


| **学位**                            |       **缩写**     |      **首字母缩略词** |
| ----------------------------------- |  ------------ | ---------------- |
| *Bachelor of Arts*                  |       *bachelor's* |      *BA*  |
| *Bachelor of Science*               |     *bachelor's*  |      *BS*   |
| *Master of Arts*                    |       *master's*   |       *MA* |
| *Master of Science*                 |   *master's*       |      *MS*  |
| *Master of Business Administration* |   *master's*       |   *MBA* |
| *Doctor of Philosophy*              |       *doctorate*  |  *Ph.D.* |
| *Doctor of Medicine*                |   *doctorate*    |    *M.D.*    |

用此类表达来谈论资历和学位：

* Charles did his master's in communications.	查尔斯拿到了通信学硕士学位。
* She has a doctorate in criminal justice.	她拥有刑事司法学博士学位。

#### b) Speaking: sentence stress

**句子重音**: 使一个单词听起来更长，并以更高的音高说出来。

* **Private** schools are too **expensive**.

注意，high 和 university 在此句子中重读：

* After **high** school, I went to a private **university**.

你可以通过重读不同的词语，改变句子的含义。注意，如果 private 而不是 university被重读，句子的含义会如何变化。说话人让“大学是私立的”比“她上过大学”这一事实显得重要。

* After **high** school, I went to a **private** university.                                          

除了 private 之外，如果说话人还重读 I，注意句子意思是如何改变的。现在，说话人强调她上了一所私立大学，而也许其他人没有。

* After **high** school, I went to a **private** university.

B: Well...
C: I mean, the advantages are obvious. There's a great college near here, and the tutor's an expert in his field.
B: Yes, but these classes have their disadvantages. There's a set schedule, and if you miss a class, you lose it. With online classes, you can study wherever and whenever you want.

B: And they're also cheaper.
A: In your email, you suggested two dofferent online schools - Thomsen Computer Institute and the University of Wessex.
B: Yes, but I talked to a friend of mine who studied at Thomsen, and he told me it has a bad reputation. Another disadvantage is that it's a private school, so it's expensive.
A: What about Wessex?
B: I've heard a lot of good things abut it. Martin, my senior engineer, gives it a strong recommendation. One good thing is that you meet online with a live instructor once a week.
A: Un-Uhh
B: And another advantage is that you can do one class for free, to see if you like it.
C: That does sound ideal. Do they have a suitable course for your team?
B: They have a short course for people who are already engineers. It just ontroduces the newest technology.
A: How much is it?
B: Three hundred dollars. I have 10 engineers, so...

C: Yep.
B: Great. I'll send you all the details.

### 7-5-4 Writing about education in your country

```

B: Really?
A: Yeah. She was a mathematics teacher for 40 years. Now she wants to study Spanish.
B: It's not unusual for older people to go back to college.

A: My mom couldn't wait to retire. After 40 years, she'd had enough of the education system.
B: Why?
A: Oh, you know, the usual good news and bad news. One year they'd get more money, but the class size would double.
B: Right.
A: Or, the elementary and middle school students would get new textbooks, but only so they could take more tests.
B: And if the kids didn't pass the test, they failed the grade.
A: Exactly.
B: I'm totally against that. Too much time is spent on tests.

B: Cool. I'm all for gap years. I wish I'd taken one.
A: I'm in favor of them, too. But in those days, it wasn't so common for kids to take a year out like that. My mom didn't want me to go straight from school to college. She wanted me to travel and work, and that way I could figure out who I was.
B: It took me years to figure out what I wanted to do.
A: You're lucky. Some people never do.

It's Test Time
by Alicia Robins

It's August, and people are going back to college. They're also taking a lot of English language tests.

"The trend in language education is to give students tests many times a year," said Trevor Burke, City College president. "In the 1990s, we only gave tests once a year."

The tests help the college figure out which students need special language classes, he said.

"If the student passes the test, he can continue in his regular classes." But what happens if the student doesn't pass? What if the student fails?

"If the student fails, there are special classes that can help," Burke said. "Or, sometimes, he can take the test again.
```

- go to college again: go back to school
- not fail: pass
- solve: figure out
- a change: a trend

#### c) Reading: Education in the United States

```
I'm in favor of technology in education and, in fact, it's quite common for US colleges to use technology. For example, it's not unusual for students to get degrees online. I'm not surprised, because you can study whenever and wherever you want. Another trend is that students are buying electronic books, or e-books. I totally support the use of e-readers. You can read them on a mobile device – paper books are too heavy to carry! Also, I think it's wrong that paper books cost more than e-books. It's not unusual to pay $100 for a paper book. I'm all for technology in education. I just wish that technology could help me pass Monday's test in math class!
```

- I'm against the cost of books. It's not unusual to pay $100.
- Paper books are hard to carry. They're too heavy.
- I totally support e-books. You can read them on a tablet.
- It's common to use technology. Students get degrees online.

#### d) Final Task: Writing about education in your country

 ```
Class: Trends in Education
Professor Wilson

Assignment: Read the proposal below. Then write your opinion, taking a stand. Support your opinion.

Proposal: Our school committee has proposed that the middle and high schools cut physical education and sports classes next year. Instead, students will have classes for test preparation. Students will have three hours of test preparation a week. These test preparation classes will be all year long.
 ```

```
Some people think it's wrong to have physical education and sports in schools, and the trend in many schools is to focus on helping students pass tests. I'm all for test preparation, but knowing how to stay physically healthy is as important as preparing for tests, and for that reason, I'm against cutting sports from schools.
```

```
In my opinion, I disagree with our school committee. On the one hand, physical education and sports classes are very important for teenagers. To lose these courses will affect teenagers' physical and mental health. On the other hand,  It's so frequently that has test preparation a week. The study is not all for teenagers. 
```
