### 7-1-1 Talking about the environment

````
[JOAN]: I didn't realize that the city changed to matural gas from coal last month.
[TODD]: Yes. And I'm all for it. Less pollution, better air quality. Water quality has been improving recently, too.
[JOAN]: Speaking of the environment, AI and I are thinking about buying an electric car. We were looking at some online last night.
[TODD]: Really? That's a great idea. Perfect for commuting. And they're getting cheap fast.
[JOAN]: Apparently, the new ones can go up to 170 kilometes between charges.
[TODD]: I didn't know that. Agenda and I looked at our monthly expenses recently. Can you believe we're spending almost 200 dollars a month on gasoline?
[JOAN]: I believe it. Gas just keeps getting more expensive. That's why we're thinking about an electric car. They cost just a few events a kilometer to run.
[TOOD]: If you get one, I'd love to try it out.

City Builds Electric Car Charging Stations

By Tarana Anand

People can now charge their electric cars in the city parking lot.

"We've built two charging stations for electric cars," said city engineer Randolph Schmidt. "If people use more clean electricity for cars and less dirty gasoline, we can decrease air pollution."

Alma Torres commutes 80 kilometers a day to her bank job in her electric car. "The city charging stations are wonderful. They show that the city cares about saving the environment around us," she said.

The city is serious about improving water and air quality, Schmidt said. Last year, the city stopped using coal. Now, natural gas powers all city buildings.
```

* People charge electric cars at charging stations
* We've stopped using coal.
* I commute 50 kilometers a day.
* Natural gas powers all city buildings
* If we use electricity for cars, pollution decreases.

#### d) Reading: Reading about life in the future

The speakers at the Bright Ideas conference last year gave optimistic ideas about the future. I liked what Henrik Mayer said. He believes that technology will provide more health services to people who live far from hospitals. If a sick person has a mobile phone, the doctors will use teleconferencing technology to help sick people by phone.

I read a university report that said that developing countries, the US and Europe strongly disagree about pollution laws. The report said that developing countries will create more pollution than other countries because they have fewer laws about air and water quality.

A German CEO says that Africa will be a huge market for computer businesses. The CEO believes that African economies will grow by 100% by the year 2050. I am also optimistic about Africa, but it's not realistic that the economy will grow 100% in such a short time.

#### d) Final Task: Writing about life in the future

I'm generally very optimistic about the future. I believe that gasoline will be gone by the year 2100. I think that's completely realistic. We will use the sun and wind for electricity, and most cars will be electric cars. A scientist at Sunlight Motors demonstrated an electric car that can go almost 250 kilometers between charges. Many people are buying electric cars now. I think that pollution will decrease a lot over the next 10 or 20 years. Life will be good in the future.
