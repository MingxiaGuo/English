?> **Tip** Telephone，Mobilephone，Cellphone，Smartphone有什么不同？
phone是喇叭的意思,是指用电话听筒代表电话。
telephone有希腊语词头tele,远程的意思.可以远程传话的话筒就是电话。
由于在所有话筒中电话使用率远远高于其他话筒,所以在没有歧义的情况下可以用phone代指telephone,当然phone还可以代指mobilephone(手机)。 
Telephone 指包括固定电话和移动电话。mobilephone指移动电话包括cellphone和卫星电话。cellphone指蜂窝移动电话。

# 主题：问候及介绍

## 问候

**hello** 和 **hi**用来问候他人。**Hello**可以用在正式和非正式场合。**Hi** 则比较非正式。**hello** 和 **hi**都可以用在一天当中的任何时候。

Hello!   你好！

Hi!    嗨！

 

## 询问和告诉别人姓名

询问某人姓名用疑问词**what**

**What's** your name?  What's his/her name?

**I'm** Joe.

你还可以用 **My name is** + 你的名字。这比 **I'm** 稍微正式一些。

**==My name is==** *Ann.* 当某人问你的**name**时，他们通常指的是名，而非姓。

 

## 与人初次见面

当你第一次见某人时，要告诉他们见到他们很高兴。他们会回答见到你**too**很高兴。**too** 表示“也”。

A: Nice to meet you.

B: Nice to meet you, too.

 

## 告别

对话结束时用**goodbye**一词。**Bye**是**goodbye**的简短形式，更加非正式一些。

Goodbye.

Bye.

 

## 拼写

在英语中，人们通常会给两个名字：一个 **first name**, 这是您的名，和一个**last name**又称为**family name** 因为它由来于您的家族。

How do you spell your name?  你的名字怎么拼写？

How do you spell your last name? 您的姓怎么拼写？

How do you spell that?

请用**it's** 的句型说出您的名字。

A: How do you spell your last name? 

B: **It's** P-H-I-L-L-I-P-S.

用**thanks** 或 **thank you** 去感谢他人拼写他们的名字。请用**you're welcome** 对感谢予以回应。
 A: Thank you.

B: You're welcome.

 

## 数字 0-10

## 电话

*telephone phone*

请用以下问句询问他人他们的电话号码：

What's your telephone number?

What's your phone number?

What's your cellphone number?

What's your number?

要问某人另一个人的电话号码，请在那个人的名字后加 **'s**。

What's Mary's telephone number?

What's Joe's phone number?

请用**it's**句式给出一个电话号码。

A: What's John's telephone number?
