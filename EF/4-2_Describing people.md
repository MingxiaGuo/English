Does he look

## Expressions: Talking about people
```
Kate: My boyfriend... he's nice... he's good-looking. He has a mice smile, blue eyes. But his hair, it's long and dirty. I don't think he washes it. He is an artist. He spends all day painting, and that's all he does. He doesn;t have a job, he lives in his mum's house! I want a boyfriend who has a plan, successful, smart, funny, handsome. I want something different now.
