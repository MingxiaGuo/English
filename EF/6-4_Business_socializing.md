#### a) Grammar: Negative tag questions 否定反意疑问句

使用反意疑问句确定某事真假或征求同意。

用一个否定的反义疑问句跟在一个肯定句后。大多数否定的反义疑问句由**do + not +** 代词构成。注意，该动词常被缩写
* You work in marketing, don't you?	你在市场部工作，不是吗？
* You got a degree in engineering, didn't you?	你获得了工程学学位，不是吗？

如果句中有动词be, ，或类似can 或 have的助动词，在反义疑问句中用该动词。
* You are the new sales manager, aren't you?	你是新任销售经理，不是吗？
* Lynn's great, isn't she?
* He was late, wasn't he?	他迟到了，不是吗？
* You can speak Arabic, can't you?	你会讲阿拉伯语，不是吗？

* They were traveling to Edinburgh, weren't they?
* Curtis was an editor, wasn't he?
* You've got 10 years' experience, haven't you?

#### b) Speaking 
##### i) 反意疑问句的语调
 
附加疑问句语调采用 rising intonation，确认你不肯定的信息。

* He isn't on our team, is he?
* They can repair computers, can't they?
* Kyle doesn't work at X100, does he?


附加疑问句语调采用 falling intonation，确认你肯定的信息，或寻求他人赞同。

不肯定用升调，肯定用降调。

* The event lasted all weekend, didn't it?
* They can't serve customers in Asia, can they?
* Cory wasn't there, was he?

##### ii) 对话管理
 
您可以通过使用会话管理策略来增加成功对话的机会。使用这些短语表示您在回答之前正在考虑您想要说的内容：礼貌地让每个人都有同等机会说话。同时力求避免长时间的沉默。你可以通过完整回答问题来延长对话。
 
当你需要思考要说的话，使用类似表达：
* Hmm …
* Let's see ….
* Let me think.

要表示你理解了某人所说内容，示意他们继续谈话，使用类似表达：
* Uh-huh?
* Right. 
* Interesting. 

要表示你没有听清或理解某人所说内容，使用类似表达：
* I'm sorry, but could you repeat that? 
* Could you say that again, please? 
* Sorry, what was that? 

要表示你没有理解某人所说内容，使用类似表达：
* What do you mean? 
* I'm not sure I understand.
