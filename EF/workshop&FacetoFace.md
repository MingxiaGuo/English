Gray: Hi Matt, I'm looking for a new gym. You go to V-Fit, right? How is it?
Matt: I like it. It's clean, and has everything I need. What's wrong with yours?
Gray: I go to Glo. It's getting really busy.
Matt: Ah, I've been there. V-Fit is definitely not as busy.
Gray: Great! Do they have a pool?
Matt: Yes, there's an indoor pool. It's smaller than Glo's, but I think it's just as good.
Gray: Nice! And the equipment?
Matt: Nothing special. It's an older gym, so a lot of it isn't as new.
Gray: OK. How much is a basic package? You know, not including private lessons.
Matt: I can't remember. It's not as popular as Glo, so I guess it should be cheaper. Their private lessons are quite expensive, but you certainly get your money's worth.
